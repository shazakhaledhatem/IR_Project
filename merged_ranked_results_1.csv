Text: None","To those who disagree, Let me put it simply, without teachers there would have been no man on the moon. No vaccines. No indispensable medicines. ""Blacks"" and ""Whites"" would still be segregated and the hole in the Ozone layer would be twice as big. It is fair to say that each teacher around the world has played a profound role on their students whether it be in any aspect of the classroom. On average, the NSW department of education states that Australian high school teachers earn $65,000. Compared to the average Australian earning a weekly $1,191.50 and yearly $61,958 according to the Australian Bureau of Statistics. Earning such similar pay to the average Australian whilst educating students and the leaders of tomorrow, this statistic portrays the inequality of teacher pay in their levels of knowledge and leadership. Whether it be practical or theoretical, it is the role of teachers that promote the leaders of tomorrow which should entitle them with higher pay rates. Having chosen a topic on teacher""s salaries, my primary choice for contact was the minister of education, Rob Stokes. Finding contact with Stokes was what I thought quite simple, a search on the internet gave myself a contact email in which I was told I could receive a response. Now eleven days after the initial request for a response and view on my question. Nothing. Is the salary of teachers not an issue to the minister of education? Is the pay of teachers not a valid argument to raise? Without any response from the education minister, inequality of teachers pay may be of little to no interest in him. Being a high school student raising an argument for teachers salaries that continually give myself homework, discipline and uninspiring lectures, a student contrasts with the minister of education over the lack of pay his teachers are receiving. An article from the Sydney Morning Herald, written and published by Harold Mitchell in June 2016 is titled ""Why we need to pay teachers more"". Mitchell addresses the concepts and severities of teacher""s inequality of pay, continually redirecting his points from teachers pay to student""s inability to learn. Stating that ""at 19 years of age, 26% of young people do not attain year 12. They are behind for most of their life"", he directs the attention from teachers pay to the consequences many students face due to their poorly payed teachers. The effect of Mitchells relations between poorly educated students and poorly payed teachers reflects the accountability that a teacher with a low salary can have on their student""s future. As Mitchell closes his article he compares two people. The first, a young woman working on a construction site directing 20 metres of traffic with a stop/go sign. The second, a first year teacher with three years of university training. As Mitchell compares the two people, he gives the reader a short and sharp fact detailing the injustice of teacher salaries. He continues, the first young woman receives an $140,000 salary, whilst the university graduate earns a yearly $63,000. As a first year teacher is not entitled to just half of the salary of a traffic controller, Mitchell closes his article, ""Surely we should pay the people who prepare our children for the future more than we pay a person controlling a line of cars down a side street?"". Having received no contact from the deemed ""education"" experts, I relied on two of my lecture and homework giving teachers for their views on the issue I was raising. Visualising a teaching utopia with the aid of my question, both teachers were quick to respond. To my surprise, both Teacher A and Teacher B had contrasting views on the issue I was raising. Coming from the United Kingdom, Teacher A had previously been paid a salary much lower than Australian teachers. Teacher A suggested that she would therefore support a general increase in the salaries of teachers both globally and especially in the UK. Whilst delivering her view on my question, Teacher A presented a further component potentially relating the inequality of teacher pay with a global issue being woman inequality. ""It might be worth considering that teaching used to be a female dominated profession and this might have something to do with the lower rates of pay. Is teaching traditionally considered ""women""s work"" and, therefore, not deemed to be as important? Over the centuries of teaching, women have most often acted as the role models and teachers to their students. As women""s inequality and more importantly the inequality of women""s pay are still relevant in society, this presents a large factor to be considered in the salaries of teachers today. The Australian government run organisation, ""Workplace Gender Equality"", stated that on average, women earn a total of 15.3% less than the average male. The Australian Rights Commission stated that ""women must work an extra 56 days a year to earn the same pay as men doing the same work"". A point risen by Teacher A, teaching may lack in pay due to it""s background being a particularly women led career. Teacher B, contrasts the views of teacher A. Teacher B raises valid arguments against the increase of pay against teachers. He argues that all children are in need of teachers, and it is required by law, therefore the raising of the salary of teachers will force the tax payer to spend more money on their children""s education. Essentially, Teacher B argues that an increase in teacher salaries could potentially be a financial burden on families unable to afford education for their children. Furthermore, teaching staff are titled to extended holidays. He proceeds to argue that the salaries of teachers need to take into account such drastic holiday breaks when compared to the average worker. If you adjust the teacher salaries for holidays, Teacher B stated that the wage per day improves significantly. As he presents his arguments against the increase of teacher salaries and their role of inspiring the teachers of tomorrow, Teacher B paints a larger picture. He states, ""To say teachers deserve higher pay because we are at the ""coal face"" of raising the next generation is short sighted and neglects the important contributions that almost every other worker makes to society. Except lawyers and business consultants, those guys are just greedy leeches"". Teacher B includes the Australian workforce in the upbringing and inspiration upon the future leaders of tomorrow, handing the reigns of teaching knowledge from teachers to the shared workforce. Contrasting the view of Teacher A being to increase salaries of teachers, Teacher B addresses the issue in a larger picture including the Australian workforce. Teachers inspire the leaders and workforce of tomorrow. Unrelenting to pay, the role of a teacher not only develops a clear and deeper understanding of a subject, but a clear and deep understanding of an individual whilst gaining knowledge. Without the role of teachers in society, there would not have existed the light bulb nor the car. The harbor bridge would not exist and Australia may never have been found. All in all, the role of teachers provides their students with the mental courage and awareness for the future."

Text: None","As part of the debate format, in each round one is either affirming one's own case or making a rebuttal. Never both in the same round. This is to save character space. The final round is a conclusion, in which no arguments or rebuttals are made. Each side just makes a case why he felt his arguments were better. If my opponent accepts these conditions then we shall proceed. Definition Collective bargaining – workers do not bargain their salary as an individual, but collectively as an organization, usually through a trade union that represent their interests, using various tactics to obtain higher salaries and benefits, which would fail under individual action. I will use the moral framework of utilitarianism. Utilitarianism states that an action should be taken If the utility, or well being of society, will be improved overall from that action. I concede that removing collective bargaining would harm employed teachers. However in this policy, the benefit teachers obtain are so low in comparison to the utility society would receive that the good outweighs the bad. I will make the assumption that education benefits society. Education teaches students critical thinking and students learn information that can benefit themselves through a higher salary and benefit society as a whole. Schooling is an issue that affects everyone. Everyone has had to go to school at some point in their life and many parents have children in school. A well educated population is necessary If a nation wants to remain a wealthy nation and to uphold the ideas of the republic. I can embark more on why education is important, but unless questioned, I will assume it is a given. I will also demonstrate that removing collective bargaining rights would increase the efficiency of school systems and would allow for school reforms that would improve education. This benefits society since it reduces costs on education and improves education. It will note why collective bargaining in the private sector is vastly different then collective bargaining in the public sector. The collective bargaining power of unions in the private sector is relatively weak. If a labor union demands higher compensation, the private firm may be unable to deliver it, since the polices can bankrupt the firm. This is the reason why only 6.9% of workers in the private sector are privatized[1]. However, labor unions in the public sector are more powerful because they receive compensation from the state. State programs do not compete fairly against private programs. As a result, 36.2% of public employees are unionized[1]. The state can obtain funds from tax payers, offer their services for ‘free', and create laws that either disallow or make it difficult for private companies to enter the market. Private companies can only make a profit If consumers are willing to pay for the product, while the public sector can extract money through force. If one does not want a ‘public good', then he or she has to pay for it anyways or else be thrown in jail. Therefore, since the public sector does not need to worry about bankruptcy and acquiring funds as much as the private sector, labor unions can increase the price of their labor and block reform that will improve education. Teacher unions also have incredible political and social power. If a teacher union decides to go on strike then news media and parents will be in a frenzy. Parents will be upset that their child is not getting an education and it will obtain press coverage. Politicians will be blamed, and possibly lose reelection over the ordeal. Therefore, teacher unions can use strikes far more effectively more than almost any other organization. In terms of political power, teacher unions greatly influence public opinion. For example, many people believe the myth that teachers are overpaid, which I will explain later. Parents, teachers, and celebrities were able to create a huge rallies in Washington DC and Wisconsin to support them[2]. Teacher unions use their fees to pay for politician's campaign fees and lobbying. The National Educational Association has spent over 12 million dollars in Washington from 2008-2010. [3] ""Coincidentally"" , the NEA spent over twice as much money they do normally during the same time period that school choice movement became big and three well made documentary videos advocating school choice and reform. Even liberal president, Franklin D. Roosevelt, known for dramatically increasing the size of the public sector stated: ""The process of collective bargaining, as usually understood, cannot be transplanted into the public service,"" [4] It is a myth that most teachers are underpaid. As John Stossel segment shows, teachers are paid more than the average wage in America. They also enjoy many perks such as pension plans, job security, and summers off. Hour per hour, teachers make more than psychologist, chemists, and physical therapists. People choose a job based on a number of reasons. However, people are free to choice a job that he or she finds most satisfying or pays well. Nobody is forced to work an ‘underpaid' job. If teachers were indeed ‘underpaid' we would expect to see a shortage of teachers and people would not apply to be a teacher. However, If anything there is a surplus of qualified teachers. In some cities, there is a 12:1 ratio between applications and open jobs [5]. These statistics are from BEFORE the great recession. This surplus is bad since potential teachers spend hundreds of thousands of dollars to attain a degree in education, only to find that there are no jobs in education. It should also be noted that it is nearly impossible to fire a bad teacher. While in most occupations, If one is bad in one's profession or behaves poorly, he or she is fired. However, due to tenure, the legal fees, amount of steps and length of time it takes to fire a tenured teacher makes the process impossible. Accordingly, approximately only 1 in 1000 of teachers are fired while most other occupations have a much higher firing or turnover rate. For example 1 in every 57 doctors will lose their medical license[6]. Teacher unions have also successful been blocking educational reforms that would improve America's education. For example, school vouchers have been proven to improve children's reading, math and writing comprehensibility however teacher unions are taking measures to make sure these reforms do not occur[7]. Likewise, teacher unions also blocking reforms to use merit-pay. For example, in Washington DC, the school chancellor offered a plan in which teachers could give up tenure-pay for the opportunity to potential earn as much as $144,000 based on merit per year. The union would not even allow the issue to come to a vote. [6] With improvements in technology and access to capital, almost all goods and services have improved since 1970. Modern cars, phones, televisions, and computers have all improved. Many of these products are even cheaper than they were 40 years ago. However, education has become more expensive and test scores have not improved at all[8]. It is because the collective bargaining power is so strong that America has not seen any improvements in education. Removing collective bargaining power would improve schools, and reduce cost on education that taxpayers have to pay through coercion. . http://tinyurl.com...[1] . http://www.youtube.com...[2] . http://tinyurl.com...[3] . http://www.youtube.com...[4] . http://tinyurl.com...[5] . http://tinyurl.com...[6] . http://tinyurl.com...[7] . http://tinyurl.com...[8]"

I agree that some aspects of the educational system are already provided by the computer and yes, it is definitely true that you don't need a person to learn everything - education is a largely personal matter. However, if we eliminate the teacher-student interaction completely, a part of the educational experience will be lost. It's not just the act of standing before a class that makes a teacher a teacher, there's the whole social experience of learning - the working together, bouncing ideas off of one another, etc. People are always complaining about the loss of social contact that has come with the age of technology I fail to imagine what they'd be saying if the computer became the new teacher."

Text: None","To avoid teaching maths to children just because they don’t like the subject would be to shape the education system around adolescent whims. But children are not best placed to put a value on their education. They don’t know what knowledge is required for life and what skills are required for a career. They are likely to choose arbitrarily, influenced perhaps by which teachers are most strict, which subject they happen to be good at and what mood they’re in. It is for this reason that we don’t recognise children as being fully capable of making decisions about their education. Consequences of this include a government-fixed curriculum. Adults know the value of maths: one poll in America found that 34% of people named it as the most valuable subject they had studied at school.[1] We think children should be learning maths, and it follows that they will have to do it, like it or not.

Text: None","There are some strict rules that apply: 1. When you accept the debate, state your country, and state the numbers of your armed forces (aircraft, men, ships, etc.). Use this source for military numbers only, as it is the most reliable: http://www.globalfirepower.com......... 2. Each country's turn can range from about 3 days to 1 month long, so please take in consideration of how much you do in a turn, make it reasonable. (DO NOT try to win in one turn! Take into account that your opponent is also a living, thinking being that can adapt to a situation.) 3. Morale is a key factor in your armed forces' effectiveness. 4. You may produce more military forces (soldiers, ships, aircraft, tanks/humvees/cavalry), but it depends on your military budget, your country's population, and how industrialized your nation is. 5. You may choose to invade or defend. 6. You may choose whether or not it is I whom makes the first move or if it is you whom makes the first move. 7. If a nation's capital is destroyed/liberated, this does not necessarily mean that the war is won; the capital could be recaptured. 8. You can have ONLY ONE WMD. (Chooses WMD) 9. WMD is to be used as a last resort. It can only be used if there is an extreme threat to the nation. 10. IF a WMD is to be used, you MUST fully describe the effects of its' use IN DETAIL. Every aspect of the WMD's effects MUST be correct and realistic. Any unrealistic detail in the effects will cause the use of the weapon and ALL of its' effects to become void, and there will be no ""restocking"" of the WMD. Once you use it, you used it, whether or not the effects are void. 11. Every aspect of the war MUST be realistic. Any unrealistic detail will cause the entire action to be void. Three infractions of this rule will result in an immediate defeat. 12. At the beginning of the ""war,"" you MUST specify what country you are, what WMD you will use (and describing the weapon using the below rules in the weapons' list), and you must show what the entirety of your armed forces is made of (soldier count, tanks, artillery, ships, aircraft, etc.). 13. Specify what your WMD is going to be. Specify ALL measurements of the WMD (yield, range, parts-per-million, altitude, longitude, latitude, etc). 14. You may choose ONE weapon from the following list of WMDs: - Nuclear Weapon: No larger than a 50 kiloton yield. MUST specify type of detonation (underground/collapse, ground/shock, air burst/dust). MUST specify location of detonation (longitude, latitude, altitude. Also name country, province/state, and city of detonation). *I would like to thank @maydaykiller for pointing out that 20 kiloton-yield nukes are almost nonexistent, and the use thereof is not realistic.* - Chemical: Maximum 15 parts-per-million. Specify chemical type. Anthrax and all nerve agents ARE allowed, but only one can be used. - MOAB: Able to penetrate a bunker with a maximum depth of 30 feet. Any measurement under 30 feet is accepted. Must be used on bunkers ONLY. - Biological: Minimum parts-per-million of 15. Maximum initial infection of 1,000 people, but the infection may spread further. - Radiological: Specify and describe the used radioactive material at the beginning of the war. MUST specify location of detonation (longitude, latitude, altitude. Also name country, province/state, and city of detonation). 15. No allies (NATO, UN, or otherwise) under ANY circumstances. You CAN have military or diplomatic agreements and/or treaties with other nations. *I would like to thank @IcySound for pointing this out.* 16. No insults, cursing, or any inappropriate behavior. 17. No trolling. 18. Disobedience of ANY of these rules WILL result in an immediate ""strike."" 19. If you acquire 3 ""strikes,"" you immediately forfeit the debate. 20. You can acquire all 3 ""strikes"" in one round or in more than one round. Regardless of how many ""strikes"" you have in a round, you forfeit that round, and all actions in that round are void. As said before, if you have 3 ""strikes,"" you lose the war. * I have removed Ballistic Missile due to the fact that it is not a WMD unless equipped with a nuclear-tipped payload, which I will not allow as you can already have one nuclear weapon (ballistic missiles can carry up to 12 warheads). *"

Well-paid jobs used to require a suit, but this has been changing in recent years and smart-casual clothes are much more common now.

Text: None","Oil sand operations lead to deforestation, particularly when the mining is on the surface, and damage to peatland and wetlands. These landscapes are the home to (endangered) species. The production of oil sands is also water intensive, averaging three barrels of water to produce a single barrel of oil. The wastewater gathers in ‘tailing ponds’, which contain high levels of napthenic acids from the bitumen, which is toxic to wildlife and aquatic life (Unconventional Oil, 2008). In the case of Canada’s Athabasca tar sands these ponds cover 130 sq km and are leaking 11 million litres of toxic water into the Athabasca river and groundwater every day.(WWF) Finally mining is also energy intensive in itself; 1,200 cubic feet (34 m3) of natural gas is required to produce one barrel of bitumen from sub surface and about 700 cubic feet (20 m3) for surface deposits. This is however a large energy gain as a barrel of oil equivalent is about 6,000 cubic feet (170 m3) of gas.(National Energy Board, 2011)"

Text: None","In numerous cases it has been seen that many murders were committed by people who were suffering from various mental or emotional problems. Tormented childhood, improper upbringing etc are some of the reasons responsible for these convicts to act in such away. What is expected from us humans is again a ""humane approach"" to help these people. Proper medical facilities etc can be very helpful in these cases instead of just bringing their life to a dead end. There have been numerous convicts who've pursued their degrees from the prison and later have contributed to the building and development of the society as proved before. So the point which we the opposition is remonstrating is that many a times the person who is found guilty of an act may actually be innocent. What is needed is, that one chance to be given to the person. That one chance to improve upon the mistakes that were done before. That one chance to welcome a positive change which will help in SAVING a life. To further prove it that’s its society will for such a move is like there are like almost 10000 petition written to USA President to remove the Code Of Criminal Procedure that after serving the sentence of murder in the prison the person should be left on parole after he or she is deemed fit to be a part of the society again. For that matter even social networking sites such as orkut and facebook have groups and community to support the same. This proves completely the point that it’s the will of the people who wanted change in system unlike the proposition who still don’t accept change"

Text: None","if social security isn't reformed in the next couple decades, everyone will be forced to take a twenty five percent cut. what should we do about it? if we take as a premise as most people do that we should salvage the program, you run into a basic math problem. we can either ration it, or we can raise revenue, or both. as far as the rationing side of things, we can either let grandma get her check reduced, or we can focus on those who make more than they need. why are we paying trump and the richest men in the world over thirty grand a year? if we have to ration, ration towards the top and work your way down. really we should prioritize cutting these excessive payments before we even consider raising any taxes. liberals like to say raise the wage cap on what is taxed for higher income. but this only solves the problem for a couple generations. nothing to sneeze at of course, and most people don't get their tax increased. but this is just throwing money at the issue, and not fundamentally or permanently reforming the program. we also rational as need be, and restructure the program. as far as restructuring, we can make the program more of an insurance program, such that you get money if you are poor or not well off, and taper off benefits to those who are rich. we could give them something, though, so that everyone receives some benefit and all are affected. they considered doing it as insurance when they created the program, but wanted everyone to be involved, understandably, so some of this can be kept too. as a last thought, there's also the more conservative ideas of privatizing social security. the major reservation i have there is mostly for the poor and not well off. if they had to rely on what they were able to get in the market with what they invest now, they wouldn't do all that well. social security does a better job than the market for these people, if you can tolerate a little redistribution, like most people can. as far as privatizing some of it, id be concerned about ensuring we have a guaranteed minimum that people receive regardless of the market. so maybe we could go with investing say half of your tax in accounts that are well regulated, and perhaps taxing the richest accounts if need be to ensure a proper redistribution. this has the potential to raise everyone's benefit and be a win for all. we'd again though want to ensure enough is kept as a minimum for those who are not well off. it's winter, but it must not be all that cold outside, cause those of my political persuasion are still willing to put our hands in other other people's pockets instead of keeping them where it's warm, in our own. ha"

Schools, Colleges and Universities, are in my opinion “no good” in terms of gaining knowledge from different sectors. For example: in order to achieve an A* for English, you’d have to revise from your textbooks & also making sure that you’re attending to school everyday. Psychologically, it puts an extensive amount of pressure on you, due to the existence of other subjects. It’s hard to revise for an exam, and also to finish coursework for other subjects. I’m all for education, but I believe that we can achieve a much higher level of knowledge through the Internet/online, and not by going to Schools, Colleges and Universities.

Text: None","Legislatures in 16 states have loosened voting restrictions on felons over the last decade, according to a new report, a trend hailed by some rights advocates as a step toward democratic principles and fairness, especially for black Americans. What voting restrictions, if any, should be placed on felons? Because of their high incarceration rate, blacks are most affected by the voting bans that vary widely among the states, with many barring current inmates and parolees from voting until they have fulfilled their sentences, and some barring felons for life. In recent years, Iowa, Nebraska and New Mexico have repealed their lifetime bans on voting by people who have been convicted of felonies, and several other states made it easier for freed prisoners or those on probation to vote, according to the report, issued yesterday by the Sentencing Project, a liberal advocacy group in Washington. The recent changes have restored voting rights to more than 600,000 individuals, the report said. But because the country's prison population has continued to rise, a record number of Americans, 5.3 million, are still denied the vote because of criminal records, it concluded. ""It's good news that many people who'd been disqualified from voting are being re-engaged as citizens,"" said Jeremy Travis, president of the John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York and a leader of the movement to smooth the re-entry of prisoners to society. ""I think people are realizing that the country had gone too far in marginalizing a large group of people who have been convicted of felonies,"" Mr. Travis said. ""This has had profound consequences for our democracy and the participation of minorities."" But some conservatives remain philosophically opposed to any wholesale loosening of voting restrictions. ""If you're not willing to follow the law, then you shouldn't't claim the right to make the law for someone else,"" said Roger Clegg, president of the Center for Equal Opportunity, a conservative advocacy group in Washington. Mr. Clegg, who was a senior Justice Department official in the Reagan and first Bush administrations, said that those convicted of felonies should be given the vote only case by case, when they have proved to be constructive members of society. Some restrictions on voting date to the early years of the country or to the post-Civil-War period, while others were tightened during the ""get tough on crime"" era of the 1980's. By federal law, voter rules are mainly set by the states. As a result, even in presidential elections, former prisoners can vote in some states but not others. Only two states, Maine and Vermont, have no restrictions, even permitting inmates to vote. At the other extreme, three states, Florida, Kentucky and Virginia, still have lifetime bans on voting by felons. Nine others bar selected groups of offenders for life. New York, Connecticut and New Jersey, like most states, do not allow current inmates or parolees to vote. In a ballot initiative in Rhode Island this November, voters will decide whether to restore voting rights to prisoners on parole or probation, who far outnumber inmates. Early polls show public support for the measure. Advocates of change emphasize broad arguments about democratic process, but the racial disparities give the issue a special resonance and raise questions about the representation of minorities in politics. In 2004, one in eight black men were unable to vote because of a felony conviction, the report said, a rate many times higher than that for other groups. Felony convictions have left one in four black men barred from voting in five states: Alabama, Florida, Mississippi, Virginia and Wyoming, said Ryan S. King, author of the report and a policy analyst at the Sentencing Project. But Mr. Clog argued that the voting restrictions were applied evenhandedly, and that just because they had a disproportionate impact on one group, that did not make them racially discriminatory. Though data on felon voting patterns are murky, a large majority of former prisoners are believed to lean Democratic. Even with a low turnout rate, their participation could make a difference in close races, experts say. Florida's rules, for example, might have been a factor in the 2000 presidential election. Most black voters in Florida say that the state should overturn the law that prevents a half-million people of all races from casting a ballot because they are convicted felons, a St. Petersburg Times poll shows. The survey says that nine of 10 black voters in Florida think that felons who pay their debt to society should automatically have their voting right restored. Florida is one of nine states that deny the right to vote to all convicted felons who have served their time. Felons can have their rights restored by appealing to the governor and Cabinet, often a lengthy process. Support for a change to the state law is uniformly high among men and women, Republicans and Democrats, and all age groups, according to a survey of 600 African-Americans conducted by Washington-based Schroth and Associates for the St. Petersburg Times. Florida's law has been part of the state's political landscape since the 1800s and has spurred a federal class-action lawsuit against the governor and spawned several legislative efforts to overturn it. The law disproportionately impacts blacks, who tend to vote Democratic. Indeed, some research suggests that ex-felons of all races lean toward the Democratic Party. Some experts contend a change could have a big political effect in a state that was shown during last year's presidential race to be closely divided between Republicans and Democrats. The Brennan Center for Justice at New York University School of Law estimates that 500,000 felons in Florida are affected by the law. Of those, 139,000 are black people, according to the center. Christopher Uggen, a University of Minnesota sociologist who has studied the political consequences of felon disenfranchisement laws, contends that Gore would have won Florida if felons would have been allowed to vote last year. He also speculates that Florida's retired U.S. Sen. Connie Mack probably would not have won his close 1988 election if felons had been allowed to vote. However, lawyers for Gov. Jeb Bush's office have argued that the number of people who can't vote because of the law is much lower than the 500,000 cited by opponents. State Rep. Chris Smith, D-Fort Lauderdale, has filed two bills that would give felons their voting rights one year after they satisfy all sentences. Four similar bills are filed in the Senate. All are assigned to several committees -- a sign that they might have tough going in the GOP-controlled Legislature. But Smith said House Speaker Tom Feeney has floated a compromise that would allow ex-felons to apply to a local judge for clemency. Feeney was not available to comment. House Majority Leader Mike Fasano said he was unaware of any compromise offers, adding that he thought the state's present clemency process is adequate. The Republican caucus has not taken a stance on the bills though, Fasano said, and he expected vigorous committee discussion on them. Whether the bills make it to the floor of the Republican-dominated body depends on the committee chairs, he said. Gov. Bush's Select Election Task Force also has identified the issue as critical and referred it to the Legislature for review and possible action."

Text: None","I stand in affirmation, ""Resolved: In a democratic society, felons ought to retain the right to vote."" I offer the following definitions for clarification of the affirmed resolution: ï¿½Democracy- Government by the governed. Within this I must state that felons are part of ""the governed"". ï¿½Felon- Someone who commits a felony; A Felony is a level of crime that is higher in comparison than a forfeiture or a misdemeanor. Repeated crimes can rise to the level of felony offenses, such as repeated DUI's ï¿½Ought- Used to indicate advisability or prudence. ï¿½Retain- To keep or hold in a particular place, condition, or position. ï¿½The right to vote- a formal expression of preference for a candidate for office or for a proposed resolution of an issue. This right is inextricable in a democratic society to retain full citizenship. ï¿½The value of this round must be equality of opportunity which refers to the fact that all citizens MUST be equal citizens under the eyes of the law. Thus you can construe that my definition of equality is referring to equality of citizenship within a society. In this resolutional standpoint opportunity must be pertaining to the right to vote. The optimal criterion for achieving equality for this round is consistency which is Correspondence among related aspects; compatibility. Thus meaning that for equality to be reached, all citizens must be treated consistently as citizens in the eyes of the law - no one can become ""more of a citizen"" or ""less of a citizen"". By negating the resolution certain citizens are not treated consistently thus you are not treating all citizens as equals. The affirmative sole burden is to prove that the consistent treatment of the right to vote functions under equality of opportunity. Thus, upholding democracy in the resolution. While the negative's sole burden is to show consistency in equality of opportunity because it's a prerequisite to democracy, and if he or she cannot than his or her case is non-topical because it cannot uphold democracy and cannot be looked to. Observation 1: Democracy is government by the governed. Certainly convicted felons are part of the governed. When felons are not treated equally and consistently, this contradicts the concept of democracy because the governed are disallowed participation within a democratic societyï¿½ Observation 2: Some may argue that no true democracy exist. This should carry no weight in a round for two reasons. A) In the resolution itself their clames to be a democracy so If there were no true democracy than we could not be debating this topic at all. B) This is a great thought or opinion but take this example: If the president of the United States has a bill on his desk that has the exact wording of the resolution he cannot just throw that bill away because there is no democracy, in fact, by taking any action at all he would be acknowledging the fact that there is a democracy because he made a decision. Observation 3: Some may say that a negative position is that the negative can give the right to vote back to felons once they have been released from prison, yet this is entirely untrue. No where in the resolution does it say ""felons released"" or ""felons imprisoned"". Thus, any negative argument that this can win for the negative should be disregarded or turned for the affirmative because it is still winning for the affirmative. Contention 1: Disenfranchisement destroys a felon's status as an equal citizen. SubPoint A: The right to vote is a fundamental right, and as such it is central to the meaning of citizenship. Furthermore, the fundamental importance of the right to vote is not determined by its actual exercise, but merely by its possession. Possessing the right to vote is of paramount importance as it is a tool by which an individual engages in active participation - S. David Mitchell furthers ""the right to vote serves as the embodiment of political empowerment, and it is essential to the full privilege of effective citizenship."" The right to vote, therefore, can be construed not only as a means for an individual to exercise political power, but also as a necessary requirement in being a full citizen. Therefore, since the right to vote has been taken away from felons, they are no longer treated consistently and therefore are not equals. The possession of the right to vote, or more aptly the opportunity to participate in the political process, serves as an indicator of a person's legal status as a member of the polity, but nothing more. Conversely, the loss or infringement of that right would indicate both a repudiation of membership in the polity and a lack of full citizenship. The right to vote is a political right that allows an individual to be an active participant in the government and is exercised cyclically; it is not the determining factor of citizenship. Citizenship in fact embodies a full range of rights including, but not limited to, the possession or exercise of the right to vote. The right to vote is consistent for all citizens which helps them become equal in their society. When a felon is disenfranchised, they become non-citizens, and even when a society's laws are broken, one may forfeit liberty but must not become non-entities. To disenfranchise any group, even those that have violated the laws a democracy has established, is to render them powerless, and any hope of rehabilitation becomes revenge. When a democracy turns on its own citizens and seeks revenge, it clearly is no longer legitimate, and is a democracy in name only. ï¿½Contention 2: Disenfranchisement creates negative consequences for felons in social and economic ways. The deprivations that ex-felons encounter extend beyond the scope of the political sphere. The right to vote is integral to a citizen's sense of belonging and undeniably holds a place of critical importance in the United States for both its symbolic and practical value; it serves as a marker of inclusion for formerly excluded groups, i.e., African-Americans, women, and those under the age of eighteen. For ex-felons the right to vote is merely one of many rights denied to them in but one of several spheres of their lives. Convicted felons are denied a host of rights that govern the social and legal spheres of their life; many of these rights have more pressing importance than the opportunity to cast a ballot. To examine how felon exclusion laws infringe upon the full citizenship of both the individual ex-felon and the community, to which the ex-felon belongs, a multi-part conceptualization of citizenship will be used. The leading contemporary scholar to consider such a multi-part conceptualization of citizenship is T.H. Marshall, a British sociologist; and, it is Marshall's formulation of citizenship that frames this argument. Marshall posited that citizenship is comprised of three distinct, yet interdependent, elements: the civil, meaning individual freedom; the political, referring to the franchise; and the social, addressing an individual's economic life. The political element, according to Marshall, consists of the ""right to participate in the exercise of political power."" This element is comprised not only of the right to vote, but also includes the right to pursue public office; political power is manifested in the voice of the people and through the machinations of those chosen to serve as proxies of the people. The rights most commonly associated with the civil element are those rights that are ""necessary for individual freedom,"" and in the context of the United States are embodied in the Bill of Rights. So since I show you that the disenfranchisement of felons is inconsistent with the rest of the members of society because it makes them unequal which is unlawful because in the eyes of the law all citizens are equally citizens, I strongly urge you to vote affirmative."

Text: None","Resolved: In a democratic society felons ought to retain the right to vote Value: democratic society Value Criterion: Maximizing political participation Contention 1: A democratic society can not be legitimate if the people in it are not voting. This is because the definition of democracy dictates that we let every competent adult vote. If we bar felons from voting then we are not truly a democracy. Contention 2: Furthermore if we continue to disenfranchise felons then not only are we undemocratic but we are also racist. This is because in America the majority of felons tend to be minorities. In fact according to the Department of Justice for every 15,000 felons sentenced to prison 450 were white 1,356 were Hispanic and 3,188 were black. Therefore as one can clearly see felon disenfranchisement excludes a whole class of people from the voting process. As stated in my previous statistic the two major minorities that make up the majorities of felons in America are blacks and Hispanics. Due to this the voices of these two groups of people is not generally heard. So if one were to vote neg. this could in effect lead to the genocide of minorities as their voice would be stifled in the government. This proves that supporting felon disenfranchisement supports racism. Contention 3: Not only does felon disenfranchisement supports racism but it can change the result of important elections. Blacks and Hispanics generally vote Democratic. As these minorities make up the majorities of felons felon disenfranchisement favors the white dominated Republican party and skews the results of elections. An example of this would be my state of Florida in the 2004 election. If felons had been allowed to vote there is no way that George Bush would have won the presidency. Though Gore had the popular vote Bush had more electoral votes which enabled him to win. However if felons had been allowed to vote Gore would have had not only the popular vote but the electoral votes necessary to win. Contention 4: Additionally felon disenfranchisement is not truly a punishment. Disallowing felons from voting does nothing correct their behavior or to prevent them from committing a crime again. If anything it further separates them from society. This is injustice for if a man committed a felony in his late teens and is kept from voting from every election each time a new political figure come to power he will have to remember the mistake he made as a teen. He may be a reformed and upstanding member of society yet he will still be unable to vote. For these reason I support the affirmative of this resolution."

Text: None","Five point three million Americans are denied the right to vote, simply because of their criminal records. If these convicts were able to vote it may amount to the difference in who our country's own president may be. It could have a huge impact on the laws that are in affect as well. This is why I stand in firm affirmation of the resolution; Resolved: in a democratic society, felons ought to retain the right to vote. President of John Jay College of Criminal Justice, Jeremy Travis, stated that, ""In more than a dozen states, a convicted felon loses the right to vote-for life. Thirty-two states prohibit offenders on probation or parole from voting."" ""In states with lifetime bans, the consequences for democratic participation are deeply disturbing."" Before we discuss the topic any farther I would first like to establish and clarify some key definitions and terms. Democratic:pertaining to or characterized by the principle of political or social equality for all Society: a highly structured system of human organization for large-scale community living that normally furnishes protection, continuity, security, and a national identity for its members Felon:one who has committed a felony Retain:to continue to use, practice Right to Vote:a legal right guaranteed by the United States Constitution Contention 1:Convicts and Ex-convicts are treated like any other average citizen in every other aspect of their lives. Felons are expected to follow and obey the laws just the same as you and me. Why should we not give them the right to help choose the leaders they have to follow and vote on the laws that they are expected to obey? If felons are responsible to uphold the standard set by society, they should have the same rights and privileges as others. Steve Chapman stated, ""We let ex-cons marry, reproduce, buy beer, own property, and drive. They don't lose their freedom of religion, their right against self-incrimination, or their right not to have soldiers quartered in their home in a time of war. But, the assumption in most places is that they can't be trusted to help choose our leaders. If we thought criminals could never be reformed, we wouldn't let them out of prison in the first place."" In some states, Maine and Vermont, felons are allowed to vote even while being incarcerated. How can one justify this being fair to a convict in Missouri. It should be a standard all across the board that everyone's voting rights are treated equally, even a felon's(see Equal Protection Clause, Contention 3). Allowing one felon to vote and not allowing another to is creating a double standard based on location, which has no legitimate effect on voting rights. Contention 2:Felons are serving or have served the punishment they were sentenced for their crime. A judge is a highly trained professional. They make decisions to determine punishments and consequences accordingly. When they sentence a felon they sentence them to a punishment that is adequate to the crime they committed. There is no reason for society to think of themselves above a felon and impose further regulations. It is not our place to judge others when we ourselves could just as easily be in their place. By denying a felon this right we are demoralizing them and depriving them of their basic human rights. We are alienating them from society. A felon has already been given a punishment for the crime they committed so why should we make them keep suffering for something that happened in the past and was already dealt with? We are taking away the capability for a felon to fix their life and reform into the ""average Joe."" By doing this we are putting society in a susceptible position. Contention 3: The right for everybody to vote is protected by the constitution. Amendment VIII of the Constitution states, ""Excessive bail shall not be required, nor excessive fines imposed, nor cruel or unusual punishments inflicted."" Also according to the National Voter Registration Act of 1993, ""Congress finds that the right of citizens of the United States to vote is a fundamental right."" Contrary to the beliefs of many that voting is a privilege, Congress itself wrote that it is a right that ALL United States citizens have, regardless of any discriminatory factor. Lastly, there is this little part of the Constitution that is referred to as ""The Equal Protection Clause.(Amendment XIV, Section 1)."" It states that, ""No state shall enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States."" This makes it clear that any ordinance outlawing a citizen's right to vote is unconstitutional. The United States was established under the values and morals of our country's founding fathers. As I have shown with my three points of contention, they clearly had the intent of allowing all citizens the right to vote, no matter what the circumstances may have been. Felons, as I stated in my first contention, are expected to follow the same laws. Taking away more basic human rights separates them from society. If citizens expect laws to be followed, everyone needs equal input on the making of these laws. Not only do we need to follow through with the resolution because of the hypocrisy and double-standards involved, but also because it is protected constitutionally. The VIII amendment to the constitution, The National Voter Registration Act of 1993, and the Equal Protection Clause all reference that disenfranchisement is wrong. Also, Making a felon pay for their mistake even after completing their sentencing completely violates my second point of contention. They were given an appropriate sentencing. Taking away the right to vote was not included in it. For the reasons I have stated above I know the affirmative side is the right side. This is why I urge you to return a negative ballot today. Thank You."

Text: None","When you kill a man, you steal a life. When you tell a lie, you steal someone's right to the truth. When you cheat, you steal the right to fairness. There is no act more wretched than stealing. Where when dealing with a democratic society which strives for justice by means of considering its consequences one must negate the following resolution resolved: In a democratic society felons ought to retain the right to vote. Ones sole value is that of punishment supported through a value criterion of retributive justice. The following definitions need be offered to earn weight in the round: steal, retributive justice, and punishment. Where steal is defined as the deprivation of something, in this case steal refers to the taking or depriving of others rights. And retributive justice is defined as a matter of giving those who violate human rights law and commit crimes against humanity their ""just deserts."" Punishment is thought to reinforce the rules of international law and to deny those who have violated those rules any unfair advantages. Together with restorative justice, retribution is concerned with restoring victims and offenders to their rightful position Punishment in its most simplified form is constituted by imposing some burden or by some form of deprivation or by withholding some benefit. Specifying the deprivation as a deprivation of rights is a helpful reminder that a crime is (among other things) a violation of the victim's rights, and the harm thus done is akin to the kind of harm a punishment does. Deprivation has no covert or subjective reference; punishment is an objectively judged loss or burden imposed on a convicted offender. Which is why we must look to retribution to justify the act of stealing or depriving of the right to vote. Its merely a more sophisticated version of an eye for an eye mentality. Brief overview The purpose of imprisoning felons is to remove them from society because they've been deemed a harmful influence. Allowing them to vote (the sole purpose of which is to influence government and therefore society) would be counterproductive to imprisonment. This is why for the following reasons you must oppose the resolution Con 1 Felons are considered less trustworthy. Full rights are often not completely restored following conviction. society considers convicts, even those who have completed their prison terms, to be less trustworthy than non-convicted citizens. For example, federal law prohibits the possession of a firearm for anyone indicted for or convicted of a felony punishable by at least one year in prison. Also under federal law, anyone who has a ""charge pending"" or has been convicted of a crime punishable by imprisonment for one year or more cannot serve on a jury. So if someone who has a ""charge pending"" against him is deemed incapable of sitting in judgment of the fate of a single litigant, it hardly seems unreasonable to say that someone convicted of a felony cannot help shape the fate of a city, a state, or the entire nation. Even outside the realm of civic rights and privileges, society recognizes that an exconvict may be less reliable than others. For example, employers routinely ask prospective employees whether they have been arrested (let alone convicted of a felony) because they suspect that the mere fact of an arrest may be an indication of untrustworthiness. Where in a democratic society untrustworthiness is not a value to be upheld. Con2 Felon disenfranchisement is justified by ""distribution."" according to the theory of Universalizability: ""whatever is right (or wrong) in one situation is right (or wrong) in any relevantly similar situation"" (Harris et al., p. 37). Universalizability as described above is a basic logical feature of all moral discourse. That is, in making a distinctively moral judgment, you commit yourself to its universalizability. If in making a judgment you refuse to recognize its universalizability, then you are actually refusing to make a moral judgment. Essentially it's a principle of consistency. Where sense it is consistent and applied to all cases its in turn just. Under the affirmative they have to say felons who have committed voters fraud should be able to vote. Con 3 Requirements We don't let everyone vote; children, noncitizens and the mentally incompetent don't. Voting requires certain minimum, objective standards of trustworthiness, loyalty and responsibility, and those who have committed serious crimes against their fellow citizens don't meet those standards. If you refer to the meaning of mentally incompetent you can see that incompetent means one who cant weigh morally right or wrong, thus is deprived of the right to vote. Whereas if you apply that understanding to a felon you can clearly see they were not able to weigh the difference between morally right and wrong, which deems them as mentally incompetent which limits them to the right to vote. Because to participate in self-government, you must be willing to accept the rule of law and even more so understand it."

Text: None","I look for ward to this debate and hope my opponent does too. Value: Democratic society Value Criterion: Maximizing political participation Definitions: Democracy:government by the people; a form of government in which the supreme power is vested in the people and exercised directly by them or by their elected agents under a free electoral system Felon:a person who has committed a felony Ought:used to express duty or moral obligation Contention 1: A democratic society can not be legitimate if the people in it are not voting. This is because the definition of democracy dictates that we let every competent adult vote. If we bar felons from voting then we are not truly a democracy. Contention 2: Furthermore if we continue to disenfranchise felons then not only are we undemocratic but we are also racist. This is because in America the majority of felons tend to be minorities. In fact according to the Department of Justice for every 15,000 felons sentenced to prison 450 were white 1,356 were Hispanic and 3,188 were black. Therefore as one can clearly see felon disenfranchisement excludes a whole class of people from the voting process. As stated in my previous statistic the two major minorities that make up the majorities of felons in America are blacks and Hispanics. Due to this the voices of these two groups of people is not generally heard. So if one were to vote neg. this could in effect lead to the genocide of minorities as their voice would be stifled in the government. This proves that supporting felon disenfranchisement supports racism. Contention 3: Not only does felon disenfranchisement supports racism but it can change the result of important elections. Blacks and Hispanics generally vote Democratic. As these minorities make up the majorities of felons felon disenfranchisement favors the white dominated Republican party and skews the results of elections. An example of this would be my state of Florida in the 2004 election. If felons had been allowed to vote there is no way that George Bush would have won the presidency. Though Gore had the popular vote Bush had more electoral votes which enabled him to win. However if felons had been allowed to vote Gore would have had not only the popular vote but the electoral votes necessary to win. Contention 4: Additionally felon disenfranchisement is not truly a punishment. Disallowing felons from voting does nothing correct their behavior or to prevent them from committing a crime again. If anything it further separates them from society. This is injustice for if a man committed a felony in his late teens and is kept from voting from every election each time a new political figure come to power he will have to remember the mistake he made as a teen. He may be a reformed and upstanding member of society yet he will still be unable to vote. For these reason I support the affirmative of this resolution."

Text: None","R: Felons should have voting rights in the modern U. S. Clarification/Context So as to be as clear as possible. I am arguing that so called Felons should retain the right to vote in spite of being felons. Below is some basic information on the current circumstance in regard to the debate topic. “The idea of taking away a criminal's right to vote has been around since ancient Greece and Rome. A condition called ""civil death"" in Europe involved the forfeiture of property, the loss of the right to appear in court, and a prohibition on entering into contracts, as well as the loss of voting rights. Civil death was brought to America by English colonists, but most aspects of it were eventually abolished, leaving only felon disenfranchisement intact in some parts of modern America. ”(1)“5.3 million Americans (1 in 40 adults) were unable to vote due to a felony conviction in the 2008 elections. This included 1.4 million African-American men, more than 676,000 women, and 2.1 million ex-offenders who have completed their sentences. “(1) “State approaches to felon disenfranchisement vary tremendously. In Maine and Vermont, felons never lose their right to vote, even while they are incarcerated. In Florida, Iowa, Kentucky, and Virginia, felons and ex-felons permanently lose their right to vote, without a pardon from the governor. Virginia and Florida have supplementary programs which facilitate gubernatorial pardons. The remaining 45 states have 45 different approaches to the issue. In 38 states and the District of Columbia, most ex-felons automatically gain the right to vote upon the completion of their sentence. In some states, ex-felons must wait for a certain period of time after the completion of their sentence before rights can be restored. In some states, an ex-felon must apply to have voting rights restored. ”(1) Burden of proofAs I am proposing the change to the status quo, I accept the burden of proof. I must affirm the resolution.

Text: None","The first and most basic reason that marijuana should be legal is that there is no good reason for it not to be legal. Some people ask 'why should marijuana be legalized?"" but we should ask ""Why should marijuana be illegal?"" From a philosophical point of view, individuals deserve the right to make choices for themselves. The government only has a right to limit those choices if the individuals actions endanger someone else. This does not apply to marijuana, since the individual who chooses to use marijuana does so according to his or her own free will. The government also may have a right to limit individual actions if the actions pose a significant threat to the individual. But this argument does not logically apply to marijuana because marijuana is far less dangerous than some drugs which are legal, such as alcohol and tobacco The second important reason that marijuana should be legal is that it would save our government lots of money. In the United States, all levels of government (federal, state, and local authorities) participate in the ""War on Drugs."" We currently spend billions of dollars every year to chase peaceful people who happen to like to get high. These people get locked up in prison and the taxpayers have to foot the bill. We have to pay for food, housing, health care, attorney fees, court costs, and other expenses to lock these people up. This is extremely expensive! We could save billions of dollars every year as a nation if we stop wasting money locking people up for having marijuana. In addition, if marijuana were legal, the government would be able to collect taxes on it, and would have a lot more money to pay for effective drug education programs and other important causes. The third major reason that marijuana should be legal is because prohibition does not help the country in any way, and causes a lot of problems. There is no good evidence that prohibition decreases drug use, and there are several theories that suggest prohibition might actually increase drug use (i.e. the ""forbidden fruit"" effect, and easier accessibility for youth). One unintended effect of marijuana prohibition is that marijuana is very popular in American high schools. Why? Because it is available. You don't have to be 21 to buy marijuana -- marijuana dealers usually don't care how old you are as long as you have money. It is actually easier for many high school students to obtain marijuana than it is for them to obtain alcohol, because alcohol is legal and therefore regulated to keep it away from kids. If our goal is to reduce drug consumption, then we should focus on open and honest programs to educate youth, regulation to keep drugs away from kids, and treatment programs for people with drug problems. But the current prohibition scheme does not allow such reasonable approaches to marijuana; instead we are stuck with 'DARE' police officers spreading lies about drugs in schools, and policies that result in jail time rather than treatment for people with drug problems. We tried prohibition with alcohol, and that failed miserably. We should be able to learn our lesson and stop repeating the same mistake There are plenty of other reasons why marijuana should be legal. Just to name a few: Medicinal use: Marijuana can be used as medicine because it helps to stimulate appetite and relieve nausea in cancer and AIDS patients. Hemp: The hemp plant is a valuable natural resource. Legalizing marijuana would eliminate the confusion surrounding hemp and allow us to take advantage of hemp's agricultural and industrial uses. Religious Use:Some religions instruct their followers to use marijuana. Just like Christianity and Judaism instruct their followers to drink wine on certain occaisions, some Hindus, Buddhists, Rastafarians, and members of other religions use marijuana as part of their spiritual and religious ceremonies. These people deserve the freedom to practice their religion as they see fit. The First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution says that the government cannot 'prohibit the free exercise' of religion, and so marijuana should be legal."

Text: None","I believe uniforms are vital in school. According to the National Center for Education Statistics, Between the years 2015 and 2016 22% of public schools acquired uniforms. This is because uniforms are believed to help students focus more on education than what they are wearing. If students are wearing expensive clothes at school, They will definitely regret it. The clothes might get stained, Painted on or even ripped. Even with stitching, Expensive clothes look horrible when ripped. Furthermore, Students have fewer chances of getting bullied when wearing uniforms. This is because everyone would be wearing the exact same clothes; therefore, There would be no reason to bully others. No one wants to get bullied for what they like to wear. On trips, Students are supposed to wear school uniforms. When they get lost, It will be easier to find them. It is better than searching for a specific person with clothes anybody can wear. We can't deny that kids adore the thought of not having to decide what to wear each day. Instead of spending hours of time putting together outfits, A student simply puts on their uniform. Chant'e Haskins shared her opinion after going from a school with no uniforms to one with uniforms. She says after wearing the uniform for a whole school year she ""was so used to wearing the uniform it did not even bother me anymore. "" Chant'e adds she saved time in the morning by not having to pick out an outfit and was able to customize her look with accessories to keep some individuality. Proponents suggest kids who wear school uniforms feel more connected to their school, Encounter less bullying, And have a more professional attitude. All of these factors contribute to more positive behaviour in school. In one school's online survey, About 25% of student respondents said they believe school uniforms would promote positive behaviour. It is generally thought that students who wear school uniforms behave more appropriately in the school environment. They believe that uniforms dictate a stricter atmosphere and that students who wear uniforms are more likely to follow school rules. Again, I must repeat that school uniforms are beneficial in many ways to both the students and the school."

This is because uniforms are believed to help students focus more on education than what they are wearing. If students are wearing expensive clothes at school, They will definitely regret it. The clothes might get stained, Painted on or even ripped. Even with stitching, Expensive clothes look horrible when ripped. Furthermore, Students have fewer chances of getting bullied when wearing uniforms. This is because everyone would be wearing the exact same clothes; therefore, There would be no reason to bully others. No one wants to get bullied for what they like to wear. On trips, Students are supposed to wear school uniforms. When they get lost, It will be easier to find them. It is better than searching for a specific person with clothes anybody can wear. We can't deny that kids adore the thought of not having to decide what to wear each day. Instead of spending hours of time putting together outfits, A student simply puts on their uniform. Chant'e Haskins shared her opinion after going from a school with no uniforms to one with uniforms. She says after wearing the uniform for a whole school year she ""was so used to wearing the uniform it did not even bother me anymore. "" Chant'e adds she saved time in the morning by not having to pick out an outfit and was able to customize her look with accessories to keep some individuality. Proponents suggest kids who wear school uniforms feel more connected to their school, Encounter less bullying, And have a more professional attitude. All of these factors contribute to more positive behaviour in school. In one school's online survey, About 25% of student respondents said they believe school uniforms would promote positive behaviour. It is generally thought that students who wear school uniforms behave more appropriately in the school environment. They believe that uniforms dictate a stricter atmosphere and that students who wear uniforms are more likely to follow school rules. Again, I must repeat that school uniforms are beneficial in many ways to both the students and the school."

Text: None","Hello, this is my first debate. I wish good luck to my opponents.Commenters please advice me in the comments section and thank you!So let's get started.Point 1:School uniform can be a indication of the student's pride and loyalty of the school. By wearing school uniform, students will feel proud of their school. However, this only applies if the school is reputable as if the school is not reputable, the school uniform would indicate that the student is not a good student due to his school.Point 2: School uniforms help teachers and staff to identify students. This is especially useful during school trips. Imagine what would happen if school uniforms were banned, how would the teachers identify their students during mishaps and accidents? Besides, it is also easier for a teacher to do a head count of the students as most of the students would be wearing the same type of clothes. Compared to students wearing different colored clothes with different designs , students wearing the school uniform would be certainly more easily recognized.Point 3: Wearing a school uniform will change a student's mindset and attitude towards their study. Psychologist have proven that wearing the school uniform will cause a student to be more serious compared to wearing home clothes. Thus, wearing school uniform would enable a student to focus more easily during lesson.Point 4: School uniform can improve the image of a school. As the saying goes, ' The clothes makes the man' By wearing a smart standardized uniform, a student will look like a studious scholar, by wearing a shirt with a punk-like design, the student will look like a hooligan, while wearing a shirt with a cartoon design would make the student look childish and immature. The clothes of what we wear reflects who we are,even if some do not notice. For example, if we wear a tank top and yellow pants with pink polka dots to a job interview, you would be perceived as a foolish person with a can't be bothered attitude. Thus, if a group of students wears a class uniform, the school would be seen as organized and would of course make a better impression than a school with students wearing clothes of different designs.Point 5: School uniform can reduce the bullying of many students. Bullying has been a common issue in schools due to many factors. One of the factor is the clothing. Wearing inappropriate or abusive clothes can lead to a disruption in class, and also, in more serious cases, a fight. For example, if a student wore a shirt to school with the words 'Chinese Suck', the Chinese of the school would feel offended and will most probably find a way to have revenge. Some of them might even perhaps commit self harm or try to engage in a fight with the student wearing the repulsive shirt. Likewise, if outsiders see a student wearing an abusive shirt, and identify the student, it would bring a bad image to the school. Therefore, cases of bullying can be reduced if students wear the same uniform.Point 6: Due to poverty, the clothes of a poor pupil might be torn, worn or dirty. This may lead to the discrimination of other students. If all students wore the same uniform, less people would discriminate students due to their clothes as their first impression on others would be based more on the mindset , personality and attitude of the person rather than his clothes.In conclusion, the uniform may have disadvantages, however, the benefits of a uniform outweighs the negative effects of a uniform, therefore, the uniform should not be banned."

Text: None","I think students should wear school uniforms. It is because in schools where students are allowed to wear whatever they want, there are school bullies that make fun of other students who may not have a good taste in fashion. But if they all wear the same school uniforms, they can't make fun of one anothers' fashion senses which prevents this type of bullying from happening. And also, if students can wear whatever they want, they might take a longer time to leave their houses for school due to taking too long to choose what they want to wear which may cause them to be late for school."

Text: None","With the expansion and globalization of modern society, learning to communicate with others is crucial, especially in a diverse country like the United States. I feel that the current method of language learning courses in high schools is not enough and students should be immersed into more methods of language learning, especially early in childhood development so that by the end of high school, students would either be fluent, or at least at an intermediate level of fluency in a second language (or third if they already speak a foreign language at home). If necessary, parents should also encourage their child to learn more languages at home as well. From a global perspective Spanish, French, Portuguese, Arabic and Chinese are the most important spoken languages in the world for children to learn other than English. If you disagree with my suggestion, please explain why exactly you do. Your argument must be logical and if necessary, please provide evidence to support your claims."

The love that we have for our sports makes all this possible. The better the product on the field, the more opportunity to maximize revenue. For players, the better their performance, the more their worth. For the Dominican baseball player that trained for a decade prior to signing a pro contract at age 16, and earning a ticket to the USA to play minor league baseball at age 18, it’s about a better life. For the wide receiver who grew up in a rough neighborhood and overcame numerous obstacles to establish himself in the NFL, it’s about taking care of his family. For the child prodigy turned NBA superstar, maybe it’s about his influence on a generation. For owners, it’s about a business venture and appeasing a fan base. As long as we as fans continue to love our sports, there will be dollars to be made. For the coaches, it’s about a championship. At the foundation, the roots, the origin of everything for these people, I believe…lies passion for a game they love. For most in the sport industry, it may seem that money is often the main motivator, but deep down it’s about the love of the game. At least I’d like to think so."

Teenage athletes train alongside adult ones and share the same coaches, so many would succumb to the temptation and pressures to use drugs, if these were widely available and effectively endorsed by legalization. Not only are such young athletes unable to make a fully rational, informed choice about drug-taking, the health impacts upon growing bodies would be even worse than for adult users. It would also send a positive message about drug culture in general, making the use of “recreational drugs” with all their accompanying evils more widespread."

Text: None","Here I will argue for the presumption that the United States should change towards the use of alternative fuel and away from fossil fuels. I define the United States to mean the public as a whole and not just the government. Alternative fuels are fuels that are other substances other than the conventional fossil fuels that can be made and used as fuels; renewable energy source. Fossil fuels can be defined as a non-renewable energy source that is formed by the decomposition of organic matter under a layer of sand and silt which produce the heat and pressure that change its chemical structure over a time period of millions of years. From these definitions, the primary inference is that the American people and government should use renewable energy sources more and non-renewable energy sources less. The presumption is that the United States uses fossil fuels more than alternative fuels such as fuels made from yellow grease, a used frying oil from deep fryers. The formation of fossil fuels was done within a process of millions of years as the plant and animal organic material was covered by layers of sand and silt and forced to decompose under such pressure and heat. Today we are using such natural resources faster than it can be reproduced. The real debate will start in round 2, once there is an understanding as to whether the opponent agrees or disagrees with the above definitions and presumption."

Text: None","Markets in sex are shaped by values that differ from non-market sexual relationships.  Market sexual transactions are not structured by the ideals of fidelity and exclusivity between social intimates, but rather by the ends of profit maximization and mutual benefit among strangers. The goods exchanged in a market are interchangeable with other goods, in ways that maximize profit and mutual benefit. When these goods include sexual services, the sexual services of one provider will be interchangeable with those of another. The position of seller or buyer in a particular market is often determined by one’s gender, class, race, and nationality.  In sex markets, sellers are typically female, and buyers are typically male.   Race, class, and other social hierarchies also shape one’s position in a sex market.   Because the sellers in sex markets are often people who are disadvantaged by their gender, class, race, or nationality, the existence of markets in their sexual services will promote the idea that the sexual capacities of women (and other disadvantaged groups) are goods that are interchangeable and exploitable.   The idea that the sexual capacities of women (and girls) can be accessed as market goods or commodities will shape attitudes toward women and girls who do not enter sex markets as providers.  In this way, the values that structure markets in sex will spill over into non-market sexual relationships, and lead men to regard women as replaceable goods rather than unique human subjects."

Text: None","Women have a right to choose where and with whom they would like to give birth. My question is why would a woman choose to have her baby at home when she has the option to be at a hospital or birthing center? Even if you have a 100% complication free pregnancy, labor can quickly turn sour and you might need a doctors intervention. Not to mention hospitals are sterile, and have every piece of equipment needed in case of any emergencies that might occur during delivery. In the event of wanting a natural birth(no pain medication, etc.), why not do so in a safe surrounding in a hospital or birthing center? The difference between that and a home birth is, if a problem ensues there will be trained Obstetricians there to intercede. Some of the problems possibly being:"" maternal hemorrhage, shoulder dystocia, eclampsia, uteran abruption, prolapsed umbilical cord, or other obstetric emergencies which would require immediate medical care not available during a home birth"" (American Medical Association). If mother or baby died on the way to the hospital in any of the above situations it would be an unnecessary tragedy. Why would anyone put they're newborn at risk in this way, or themselves? My ancestors had they're babies at home but they also frequently lost they're children and died themselves. Also, in the case of a lower income family, there are many state programs availabe to help you have a baby practically cost free. So I want someone to take this debate to explain to me how having a home birth over rules doing everything in one's power to keep they're newborn child safe; which is a parents most important job."

However, I am referring to hyperinflation(the devaluing of currency because there is too much of it) and supply shock inflation (inflation that results because of a shortage of something crucial to the economy)."

Text: None","In Western liberal democracies, we generally consider an individual’s private sphere to be worth protecting. We only give the state license to violate it when something is objectively largely harmful to that person or to society. When something is not very clearly harmful we let people make their own decisions because the state is not infallible in its judgements about what lifestyles are better than others. Therefore, simply saying that there is a risk that printers will be misused is not sufficient grounds for banning them altogether. If technology makes it easier for people to do what they want, this is a good thing; if people then want to do things that we consider harmful this is a problem in itself. The solution is not to ban an entire means of production in order to stop a minority from producing dangerous things, but to educate people about the risks so they can freely make better decisions. Making it harder for people to do bad things is useless, furthermore, since those that wish to purchase a gun or take drugs can already find ways of doing so without 3D printers. One may even argue that it is better for everybody to have access to a gun, for example, and not only those who are willing to break the law to get one."

Text: None","Ladies and Gentlemen, I will be acting as the prosecutor in this debate and I will be advocating the banning of the user known as ""Imabench"" from DDO for violating the Terms of Service numerous times during his presence on the site. Here are the portions of the TOS that Imabench has violated: - 1) Section C of the code of conduct Imabench has uploaded many pictures that were used against conservative beliefs in debates. He has also uploaded content that is defamatory to politicians and pop culture figures in debates as well. - 2) Section O of the code of conductImabench has mentioned that he has used DDO to try to hit on Thett's sister in real life. - 3) Section T part 1 about the use of profanity. Imabench has said the word f*ck 347 times, sh*t 493 times, dumba** 128 times, and b*tch 77 times which is in blatant violation of the TOS - 4) Section T part 2 Imabench has humorously attacked the opinions of members and members themselves numerous times both in debates and in the forums - 5) Imabench has also been involved in behaviors detrimental to the site which includes but is not limited to - A - Making various sexual remarks in his debates and on the forums, at one point he even explained in detail what a ""Cleveland Steamer"" is to a 13 year old girl on DDO, claimed that 16kadams enjoys deep-throating large black dildo's, and that he tricked his grandmother into watching a video of a girl violating another girl's behind with a ping pong paddle handle. - B - He has trolled and derailed numerous debates which not to get personal is a real a**hole thing for him to do. Once he derailed a debate about there being Poop in DNA and he somehow won even though he in no way should have won that debate.... - C - He unwillingly triggered the Ima incident of 4/28 to 4/29 where 11 multiaccounts were created in his name (kind of) and went around DDO attacking members and calling for Imabench's death - D - He has spammed debates that are beyond stupid, including but not limited to,- ""DDO should have a massive sex orgy if the world ends in 2012""- ""Having 1 testicle is better than having 3 testicles""- ""Women should be given free large breast enhancements""- ""Imabench should be banned for violating the TOS""and numerous others as part of his former ""Weekly Troll debate"" campaignThat being said it has been in the interest of many people that Imabench should be banned from DDO for the reasons mentioned above. I selected to be the one advocating for the banning of myself, and I promise to not let the fact that I am prosecuting myself compromise my handling of this debate as prosecutor. As part of Imabench's demands, Imabench has called on his right to a speedy debate for his banning, thus the debate will be limited to four rounds. Imabench has also requested that the position for defending himself will be open to the public and has waived his right to appoint someone to represent himself. Therefore, whoever accepts this debate will argue on Imabench's behalf.Lastly Imabench has requested that the jury be made up of those who vote on this debate, meaning the final score of this debate will determine if Imabench will be banned or not. I will try my best to show why Imabench should be banned, whoever accepts this debate shall argue why he shouldnt be banned."

Text: None","Being a naive person, I heard about the legalization of marijuana and was horrified. It seemed simple at first glance. Why legalize something that does such terrible things to your body? It seemed dangerous, addictive, and can wreck havoc on society. I laughed at the people who wanted to legalize it, thinking of them as addicts. But I was wrong, and I""m very sorry for having such prejudice. Then I researched a bit. Legalizing it was right all along. Here""s why: Weed is addictive. No it""s not. It""s less addictive than coffee. And I see you sipping on that mug as you read this answer. Weed is dangerous. Alcohol is 114 times more dangerous. Weed causes an increase in crime. In Colorado, crime has fallen by 15%, murder has fallen by 50%. Weed will cause teenagers to get hooked. Once again, in Colorado, less high-schoolers are taking it up. Weed will still be sold, whether you legalize it or not. This is the most important point of all. If you don""t legalize it, people are just going to get it from their local drug dealer. It doesn""t change anything. People will find other sources. You might as well boost the economy with the taxes on it and provide people with a safe place to acquire weed. I hope this changed a couple of your minds, like it did to me. Trust me, do some research into this and you will see my opinion."

Text: None","These are my top 10 reasons on why marijuana should be legalized. 10. Prohibition has failed to control the use and domestic production of marijuana. The government has tried to use criminal penalties to prevent marijuana use for over 75 years and yet: marijuana is now used by over 25 million people annually, cannabis is currently the largest cash crop in the United States, and marijuana is grown all over the planet. Claims that marijuana prohibition is a successful policy are ludicrous and unsupported by the facts, and the idea that marijuana will soon be eliminated from America and the rest of the world is a ridiculous fantasy. 9. Arrests for marijuana possession disproportionately affect blacks and Hispanics and reinforce the perception that law enforcement is biased and prejudiced against minorities. African-Americans account for approximately 13% of the population of the United States and about 13.5% of annual marijuana users, however, blacks also account for 26% of all marijuana arrests. Recent studies have demonstrated that blacks and Hispanics account for the majority of marijuana possession arrests in New York City, primarily for smoking marijuana in public view. Law enforcement has failed to demonstrate that marijuana laws can be enforced fairly without regard to race; far too often minorities are arrested for marijuana use while white/non-Hispanic Americans face a much lower risk of arrest. 8. A regulated, legal market in marijuana would reduce marijuana sales and use among teenagers, as well as reduce their exposure to other drugs in the illegal market. The illegality of marijuana makes it more valuable than if it were legal, providing opportunities for teenagers to make easy money selling it to their friends. If the excessive profits for marijuana sales were ended through legalization there would be less incentive for teens to sell it to one another. Teenage use of alcohol and tobacco remain serious public health problems even though those drugs are legal for adults, however, the availability of alcohol and tobacco is not made even more widespread by providing kids with economic incentives to sell either one to their friends and peers. 7. Legalized marijuana would reduce the flow of money from the American economy to international criminal gangs. Marijuana's illegality makes foreign cultivation and smuggling to the United States extremely profitable, sending billions of dollars overseas in an underground economy while diverting funds from productive economic development. 6. Marijuana's legalization would simplify the development of hemp as a valuable and diverse agricultural crop in the United States, including its development as a new bio-fuel to reduce carbon emissions. Canada and European countries have managed to support legal hemp cultivation without legalizing marijuana, but in the United States opposition to legal marijuana remains the biggest obstacle to development of industrial hemp as a valuable agricultural commodity. As US energy policy continues to embrace and promote the development of bio-fuels as an alternative to oil dependency and a way to reduce carbon emissions, it is all the more important to develop industrial hemp as a bio-fuel source - especially since use of hemp stalks as a fuel source will not increase demand and prices for food, such as corn. Legalization of marijuana will greatly simplify the regulatory burden on prospective hemp cultivation in the United States. 5. Prohibition is based on lies and disinformation. Justification of marijuana's illegality increasingly requires distortions and selective uses of the scientific record, causing harm to the credibility of teachers, law enforcement officials, and scientists throughout the country. The dangers of marijuana use have been exaggerated for almost a century and the modern scientific record does not support the reefer madness predictions of the past and present. Many claims of marijuana's danger are based on old 20th century prejudices that originated in a time when science was uncertain how marijuana produced its characteristic effects. Since the cannabinoid receptor system was discovered in the late 1980s these hysterical concerns about marijuana's dangerousness have not been confirmed with modern research. Everyone agrees that marijuana, or any other drug use such as alcohol or tobacco use, is not for children. Nonetheless, adults have demonstrated over the last several decades that marijuana can be used moderately without harmful impacts to the individual or society. 4. Marijuana is not a lethal drug and is safer than alcohol. It is established scientific fact that marijuana is not toxic to humans; marijuana overdoses are nearly impossible, and marijuana is not nearly as addictive as alcohol or tobacco. It is unfair and unjust to treat marijuana users more harshly under the law than the users of alcohol or tobacco. 3. Marijuana is too expensive for our justice system and should instead be taxed to support beneficial government programs. Law enforcement has more important responsibilities than arresting 750,000 individuals a year for marijuana possession, especially given the additional justice costs of disposing of each of these cases. Marijuana arrests make justice more expensive and less efficient in the United States, wasting jail space, clogging up court systems, and diverting time of police, attorneys, judges, and corrections officials away from violent crime, the sexual abuse of children, and terrorism. Furthermore, taxation of marijuana can provide needed and generous funding of many important criminal justice and social programs. 2. Marijuana use has positive attributes, such as its medical value and use as a recreational drug with relatively mild side effects. Many people use marijuana because they have made an informed decision that it is good for them, especially Americans suffering from a variety of serious ailments. Marijuana provides relief from pain, nausea, spasticity, and other symptoms for many individuals who have not been treated successfully with conventional medications. Many American adults prefer marijuana to the use of alcohol as a mild and moderate way to relax. Americans use marijuana because they choose to, and one of the reasons for that choice is their personal observation that the drug has a relatively low dependence liability and easy-to-manage side effects. Most marijuana users develop tolerance to many of marijuana's side effects, and those who do not, choose to stop using the drug. Marijuana use is the result of informed consent in which individuals have decided that the benefits of use outweigh the risks, especially since, for most Americans, the greatest risk of using marijuana is the relatively low risk of arrest. 1. Marijuana users are determined to stand up to the injustice of marijuana probation and accomplish legalization, no matter how long or what it takes to succeed. Despite the threat of arrests and a variety of other punishments and sanctions marijuana users have persisted in their support for legalization for over a generation. They refuse to give up their long quest for justice because they believe in the fundamental values of American society. Prohibition has failed to silence marijuana users despite its best attempts over the last generation. The issue of marijuana's legalization is a persistent issue that, like marijuana, will simply not go away. Marijuana will be legalized because marijuana users will continue to fight for it until they succeed."

Text: None","Most people don't understand the point of tax-exempt/tax-deductible status for poor and homeless people. Having been on that side of the fence, and having a modicum of experience with the 501(c)(3) criteria, I intend to provide arguments to support my idea of tax-exempt, or tax-deductible, status for poor and homeless people. Legally, corporations - especially tax-exempt non-profits, - are considered legal entities... not unlike human beings. They're ""born"" when they're incorporated; they're fed by the donations and profits they receive; they dress in buildings, and use tools to work; they learn, by keeping records; they keep themselves healthy and functional, with the help of their volunteers and employees; their brains are their boards of directors; their immune systems are the screening processes for volunteers and employees, and legal counsel; they make statements, and follow rules; they grow old; they can develop viruses and cancers, in the form of corrupt employees, volunteers and board members; they can perform first-aide on themselves with limited liability, and get surgery done on themselves by firing or getting rid of the cause of their problems; they can be insulted by other organizations, and injured legally; they can bleed out resources, and starve without resources or profits; they must make up a will to leave their assets to another corporation, in many cases; and, they can even die. The question is: since the Law already recognizes tax-exempt organizations as being legal entities, and human beings are also legal entities, why can't human beings receive tax exemption? If homeless and poor individuals could solicit donations and volunteership from others, without repercussions, and not have to pay taxes on the charity they receive, the government would be able to shut down all kinds of programs that are not only operating in the red, but are also a burden to the average taxpayer. People would be more inclined to act charitably which, if history and psychology are any indicators, would inspire them to a higher standard of morality; nearly-simultaneously reducing illegal and immoral activity on an exponential level, and eventually inspiring them to selfless acts of kindness. In my humble opinion, win-freakin'-win, baby! Other reasons are as follows: I know a lot of people dislike the I.R.S., and want to get rid of them. Their mantra is, ""No Taxation, Without Representation!"". But, from my perspective, the Bible advocates using corrupted systems for whatever good they can provide. It also advocates joining with your enemies, to work toward a common cause... Here's why I believe that tax exemption would be good for individuals: I~ They could get the help they need, when they need it. II~ People could rest easy; knowing that their donations and volunteership are going to people who need it, in the way that they need it, and knowing as well that these people are subject to the same laws that govern other tax-exempt non-profits. III~ In return for donations and volunteership, tax-exempt individuals could give tax write-offs to people who want something in return... which would be almost as good as cash. With fewer taxes being collected, and more people getting what they need to get out of their bad situations into more stable ones, the economy will naturally revive more rapidly than any ""stimulus"" plan could ever accomplish the goal. IV~ They could get whatever they need, from the right sources, ensuring they get the best they can get... including medical help when, and in the way, they need it... hence, ensuring the uselessness of the new ""universal health-care"" laws. V~ People with this tax exemption would be able to file for it for no cost, ensuring that nobody would have to do without. VI~ Keeping proper records, these same people would be relatively free from government oppression and the ""nanny-state"". VII~ It would seriously hurt only the corrupt organizations, which would ensure a change in their policies that would be necessary for them to actually do what they say they're designed to do. VIII~ They could invest in future needs, without actually wasting the donations or volunteering they receive. IX~ At the final fulfillment of their needs, they could re-incorporate for a for-profit business; relinquish their tax exemption; or incorporate with other tax-exempt individuals into a non-profit, tax-exempt organization, with which other individuals could affiliate... ensuring unity of all the interested and involved people, and organizations, under one common cause: the betterment of their fellow ""man"". Of course, some would argue that homeless and impoverished people usually don't have to pay taxes... after all, you can't get blood from a stone, right? That's yet another part of the point: they're already half-way there!"

It is my belief that The Church Of Jesus Christ Of Latter Day Saints is the true church. There are many who say the Catholic church is the true church since it was the first Christian church. I disagree with this because the idea that a random Italian group can say that this one man can speak to god is outrageous. In history do they ever talk about who founded the Catholic Church, it just sort of showed up. Mormonism was founded by Joseph Smith when he himself was wondering ""which church is the right church?"" This young man, went into the woods by his house and prayed to our father in heaven, asking ""which church is the real church?"" Instead of receiving an answer he felt within him, God and his son Jesus Christ came down from the Heavens and explained to him that no church on the Earth at the time was the true church. He was told that he was to create a new church, one in the name of Jesus Christ himself. Thus the Church Of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints was born. I conclude my opening statement with the following, Catholicism while it may seem true, is not what it may appear to be."

Text: None","Rules:-Please keep language simple, I don't like looking up more than one word per post.-This debate should not be based on semantics. Use comments if you think a person's statement could mean two different things and you do not actually know what they are trying to say. -No new information in the 3rd round. Just rebuttals/conclusions. -By ‘language’ I mean laws, issuing ‘marriage’ license, things like that.I'd like to start out by stating I am for 'marriage' being a religious unity. I state this because I have never been to a wedding, including civil ceremonies, that did not mention God. That does not mean they do not exist, but because of the statistics, I consider 'marriage' a religious thing.That being said, I see the religious stand on why same sex marriage (SSM) should not be allowed. I also agree with them. Which is why I think the word ‘marriage’ should be removed from all government language. I believe unities are vital for our society. When it comes to children, two parents are more often better than one (1). More so if one of them stays at home, but that’s not the topic of this debate. Well, why not just live together? Government benefits of course. Not just tax breaks, but also death benefits and other public benefits. I believe states are making their own civil union laws, but some believe these laws are still not equal.(2) In short, I believe ‘marriages’ are religious and religious unions should be separate from legal unions.

Text: None","StructureR1 ArgumentsR2 RebuttalsR3 Defend your R1 argument against opponent's R2 rebuttal Bad to the bone = immoral. Full resolution: Drinking cow's milk is usually immoral. Exceptions, people with rare medical conditions, and extraordinary circumstances. For example, stranded on a desert island and/or about to go into a diabetic coma. Burden of proof will be on me to prove that drinking cow's milk is usually immoral. OutlineI. IntroII. Animal ethicsIII. HealthIV. EnvironmentV. ConclusionVI. SourcesI. IntroWe shouldn't drink bovine milk because it encourages the slavery, exploitation, and mistreatment of cows. Not only that, but slavery, exploitation, and mistreatment of one animal paves the way for this same treatment towards other animals. Cows milk is unhealthy nor environmentally sustainable. II. Animal ethics""A factory farm is a large, industrial operation that raises large numbers of animals for food. Over 99% of farm animals in the U.S. are raised in factory farms, which focus on profit and efficiency at the expense of animal welfare."" [0]Animals on so called ""humane"" farms don't fare much better. [1][2] ""Even under the best circumstances, the incentive to treat animals “humanely” is limited to the extent to which it is necessary to raise them to market weight (which is just a fraction of their natural lifespan). Any humane practice beyond this would be seen as inefficient and unsustainable by today’s business standards."" [3]Between the inherit conflict of interest between animal welfare and profit. and the brutal realities there is no moral justification for humans drinking bovine milk.III. HealthMilk causes osteoporosis and increases chances of hip fractures. Contains, IGF-1, cholesterol, casein, lactose, high in fat, high in saturated fat, and high in dead bacteria endotoxins. ""These results support the hypothesis that dairy products and calcium are associated with a greater risk of prostate cancer. "" [4]"" Studies have shown that IGFs are potent mitogens for a variety of cancer cells including prostate cancer since they stimulate cancer cell growth and suppress programmed cell death. "" [5]""Naturally occurring milk IGF-1 levels were recorded in 5777 random milk samples from the Bavarian dairy cow population."" [6]As you can see from above, milk increases cancer risk. IGF-1 is found in cow's milk and is associated with increased cancer risk. ""These findings suggest that even small intakes of foods of animal origin are associated with significant increases in plasma cholesterol concentrations, which are associated, in turn, with significant increases in chronic degenerative disease mortality rates."" [7]Casein is a protein that can cause an immune system response which can lead to type I diabetes. “Total protein consumption did not correlate with diabetes incidence (r = +0.402), but consumption of the beta-casein A1 variant did (r = +0.726). Even more pronounced was the relation between beta-casein (A1+B) consumption and diabetes (r = +0.982). These latter two cow caseins yield a bioactive peptide beta-casomorphin-7 after in vitro digestion with intestinal enzymes whereas the common A2 variant or the corresponding human or goat caseins do not. beta-casomorphin-7 has opioid properties including immunosuppression, which could account for the specificity of the relation between the consumption of some but not all beta-casein variants and diabetes incidence. “ [8] “"" Women who drank three glasses of milk or more every day had a nearly doubled risk of death and cardiovascular disease, and a 44 percent increased risk of cancer compared to women who drank less than one glass per day, the researchers found. Men's overall risk of death increased about 10 percent when they drank three or more glasses of milk daily, said the study, published online Oct. 28 in BMJ.""” [9] “The risk of any bone fracture increased 16 percent in women who drank three or more glasses daily, and the risk of a broken hip increased 60 percent, the findings indicated. “ [10] Fat is not only the densest of the three macro nutrients at 9 calories per gram as opposed to 4 for carbohydrates and proteins. This can lead to obesity and intramyocellular lipid build up.Saturated fat increases blood viscosity which makes the heart work harder. Lactose is a sugar that many people are intolerant towards. IV. EnvironmentInherently due to trophic levels milk must be worse for the environment. From the American Journal of Clinical nutrition we can see that lupine, a vegan alternative, is better for the environment than cow's milk. [11]V. ConclusionIn conclusion, there is only one ethical choice, and that is to stop drinking bovine milk. Thanks for the debate.VI.

A nuclear world war might change this situation: such a war might so shock and horrify the global human population that it will turn to world govern­ment in desperation. This outcome is possible, of course, but it is equally possible that after a nuclear Armageddon had occurred, the scattered and demoralized survivors would be neither capable of nor interested in world government. Quite likely the surface of the world would become sub-divided into a host of autonomous principalities presided over by dictatorial war lords.

Text: None","The world today is globalized and interlinked. It is not economically viable to expect developed nations to use more of their resources to combat global warming. The global economy depends on wealthy developed countries because it is them which create the high demand for the work performed by developing nations allowing countries like china to develop based upon exports. Just as the economic system is global as is pollution. There is no point in a developed country cutting its emissions in half if a developing nation replaces all those emissions and more.  For example China’s emissions are expected to rise to between 9.7billion and 12 billion metric tons[1] up from 2008’s 7billion.[2] The European Union emits 4.2 billion metric tons so China could easily offset EU emissions losses even if the EU makes very extensive cuts.[3] With the world being so linked the responsibility is equally linked it is therefore not for individual nations or even a particular group of nations to be considered to have a higher obligation but all nations are equally obligated to prevent climate change.

Text: None","Through this debate, Opposition has defended the HRC on two fronts - we’ve shown that the political inclination of the council serve the greater good, and we’ve shown that the HRC is successfully acting against HR abuse. And so, To create a world where human dignity is a given, and to join the whole world in the fight for this cause, we urge you not to abolish the HRC. Prop claimed that the current HRC is too political, like the previous HR Commission was, and so it acts non-objectively. We’ve shown that politicization exists in every organization as well as in the UN and is essential in order to create international agreement on the efforts of the HRC[[http://tinyurl.com/3kan74q]] - and so, every call against politicization is a call against international cooperation and the UN. Also, in our 5th rebuttal we’ve shown that there is no real objective decision, and that a UN body that matches Prop’s ideal dreams is impossible. When Prop suggested the replacement of the HRC with another council, without explaining how the alternative will amend any so called “faults”, we saw that Prop’s claims about the flaws of the system did not stand up to their own concession that there is need to a council of a similar form, but have failed to show a possibility for a successful alternative. Furthermore, we’ve shown how the “politicization” promotes human rights, by balancing between exposure of many countries to the subject, promoting responsibility[[http://tinyurl.com/3t46k8n]] and preventing entrenchment and protection through the rotation system[[http://tinyurl.com/3fad8pj]]. So, politicization is not only essential for a UN council, but is also a positive factor which enables the council to act internationally and is no reason for abolition. The second focal point of this debate concerned the way that the HRC supports or harms HR. Prop claimed that the HRC made no progress to promote HR, isn’t tackling HR issues where they happen and actually harming HR - without sufficient proof of harm. We’ve shown that the HRC is acting in a unique and essential way, so if there is no alternative to it. the council is succesfully promoting HR in several distinct cases[[http://tinyurl.com/3t6ks6y]], it should be abolished. Hence, simply removing it, and by doing so stopping the current efforts of the HRC would greatly harm the global fight for HR causes. Furthermore, we explored Prop’s actual claims in the 6th rebuttal, and the HRC actual mandate, proving that the HRC does stand up to its mandate[[tinyurl.com/3sbm33n]] & that Prop’s expectations are illogical, if not impossible. Even if it is not magically solving all of the world problems, it is achieving a substantial amount of good without no concrete harm - its doing exactly what it’s supposed to do. And so, because the HRC is achieving its goals, and displays excellent achievements given the natural limitations imposed on any UN council, we see no reason to abolish it."

Text: None","Much of the ""Yes"" case on this point relies on an assessment of harms- particularly, on the analysis that since the primary harms of drug use are to the individual, the state has no role: ""Adults should be able to choose what they put in their body, the government’s duty of care should not override the freedom of the individual to make choices that hurt no one but themselves."" This point, however, fails to take into account the reason why drugs have continued to be restricted. While heroin or crack cocaine addiction initially harms the user's health, it also has wider social implications: as addiction spirals out of control, the addict has to spend greater amounts on buying the drug, and often turns to crime to fund this. Theft and prostitution are common offences among drug addicts, and cost society dearly in financial terms and in the threats they pose to personal safety and freedoms. The ""yes"" case also suggests that , through legalising drugs, legitimate business organisations which take over the industry, allowing government to tax drug supply and therefore use the funds to finance rehabilitation. However, this is an unrealistic assumption on two grounds: firstly, because respectable businesses would be unwilling to openly supply products to which are attached a social stigma and various associated risks, and because the roots of drug supply would still be controlled in countries such as Colombia and Afghanistan by hostile militant groups; and secondly, because any legal industry has substantially higher production and development costs, and therefore higher prices, to which government taxes are added, the price of drugs would soar. This would force drug addicts either to continue using illegal sources, or to fund their now more expensive habit through further use of crime."

Here are the portions of the TOS that Imabench has violated: - 1) Section C of the code of conduct Imabench has uploaded many pictures that were used against conservative beliefs in debates. He has also uploaded content that is defamatory to politicians and pop culture figures in debates as well. - 2) Section O of the code of conductImabench has mentioned that he has used DDO to try to hit on Thett's sister in real life. - 3) Section T part 1 about the use of profanity. Imabench has said the word f*ck 347 times, sh*t 493 times, dumba** 128 times, and b*tch 77 times which is in blatant violation of the TOS - 4) Section T part 2 Imabench has humorously attacked the opinions of members and members themselves numerous times both in debates and in the forums - 5) Imabench has also been involved in behaviors detrimental to the site which includes but is not limited to - A - Making various sexual remarks in his debates and on the forums, at one point he even explained in detail what a ""Cleveland Steamer"" is to a 13 year old girl on DDO, claimed that 16kadams enjoys deep-throating large black dildo's, and that he tricked his grandmother into watching a video of a girl violating another girl's behind with a ping pong paddle handle. - B - He has trolled and derailed numerous debates which not to get personal is a real a**hole thing for him to do. Once he derailed a debate about there being Poop in DNA and he somehow won even though he in no way should have won that debate.... - C - He unwillingly triggered the Ima incident of 4/28 to 4/29 where 11 multiaccounts were created in his name (kind of) and went around DDO attacking members and calling for Imabench's death - D - He has spammed debates that are beyond stupid, including but not limited to,- ""DDO should have a massive sex orgy if the world ends in 2012""- ""Having 1 testicle is better than having 3 testicles""- ""Women should be given free large breast enhancements""- ""Imabench should be banned for violating the TOS""and numerous others as part of his former ""Weekly Troll debate"" campaignThat being said it has been in the interest of many people that Imabench should be banned from DDO for the reasons mentioned above. I selected to be the one advocating for the banning of myself, and I promise to not let the fact that I am prosecuting myself compromise my handling of this debate as prosecutor. As part of Imabench's demands, Imabench has called on his right to a speedy debate for his banning, thus the debate will be limited to four rounds. Imabench has also requested that the position for defending himself will be open to the public and has waived his right to appoint someone to represent himself. Therefore, whoever accepts this debate will argue on Imabench's behalf.Lastly Imabench has requested that the jury be made up of those who vote on this debate, meaning the final score of this debate will determine if Imabench will be banned or not. I will try my best to show why Imabench should be banned, whoever accepts this debate shall argue why he shouldnt be banned."

Legalising euthanasia, and yes! don't ignore it- sooner or later it will affect you and your familly. Euthanasia encourages the killing of humans. I strongly believe that in any state Euthanasia (that painfull injection of DEATH) should be demolished and strictly prohibited! Thankyou"

Text: None","Hello, Iannan13, As you said in one of your comments concerning euthanasia, ""You legalize Euthanasia, then you give the government the right to kill the sick and elderly."" I would like to disagree with you. True, this kind of problem might appear if euthanasia is legalized. Most people are afraid that euthanasia can be used maliciously, as a justification for murder. Despite the fact that the argument against legalization of euthanasia sounds reasonable, especially in Russia, for instance, I believe that it can and should be legally regulated. Medical practices nowadays provide a solid platform for many lawsuits; thus, hospitals already have whole departments that provide legal service. These lawsuits usually concern medical malpractice and conflicts of interest between the patient and his/her family. In some sense, it could also cover the case of euthanasia. Therefore, thoughtful legal regulations that involve medical evidence of someone having a terminal disease along with the patient""s consent will most likely be enough to deal with the entire legal issue of euthanasia."

Text: None","Could someone please tell me the good that comes from Euthanasia? I don't understand what good can come from killing someone. Life is A beautiful gift. We are called to love one another and respect each other as human beings. Even when someone is suffering immense pain and anguish, life can still be full of joy and happiness. Since Euthanasia is the end all choice and after that decision there are no more decisions... Why are we promoting it? It seems to me that we should be focusing more on trying to pull out and show these people what good can come from life, by loving them cherishing their life as A blessing and making their final days here full of love, instead of focusing on the unfortunate situation they are in and then killing them. It all seems so backwards to me."

Text: None","High taxes act as a disincentive to entrepreneurs it separates people from the fruits of their labour. Often new ventures are started at great financial risk by the founder and excessive taxation can skew the risk/reward ratio to the point where the enterprise is no longer worth the bother. In the business case, companies need to accumulate capital in order to expand their operations or break in to new markets and maintain working capital to cover the expenses of their day-to-day business activities. Forcing a business to go into or maintain a debt due to tax incurs a cost to the business and ultimately results in a less stable and/or competitive business. History has shown repeatedly that private enterprise is a more efficient allocator of assets than the government, as private enterprise takes in to account the relative cost of any action, reduced down to monetary terms (the profit motive). This is not to say that taxes and government are unnecessary, as non-revenue generating infrastructure is required to be built and maintained in order to facilitate modern life. But when the burden of taxation begins to affect and retard economic enterprise, society as a whole loses out."

Text: None","As stated. A Flat tax rate directly causes income and wealth inequality in any country it's instituted in. This results in the creation of exorbitantly individuals along side extremely poor, and what exactly are the alternatives? 1. Progressive tax, a higher tax percentage depending on your income, I.E. A man who makes 35,000$ has to pay 5% of his income while a man who makes 1,000,000$ pays 20%. 2.Head Tax, everybody pays the same amount, regardless of income. No explanation needed to why this mode is unfair and ineffective. I believe in a progressive tax. A strong and widespread Middle class is the catalyst to being a global superpower, tell me I'm wrong. Spreading these large amounts of money that individuals possess back to lower classes and the Government supports much more then If it was to be stored in a bank. ""Dead Money"", as its coined by economists, Pun there. This money that's not being circulated is a Direct cause to Inflation, and I would daresay a direct cause to Recession. Now, before I open the floor to a pro opponent, I would like to refute a claim in advance, because I know it will be brought up. ""Imagine a 55 year old lawyer, who paid thousands and thousands of dollars to put himself through university, who worked hard his whole life, has to fund and support lazy and poorer individuals, simply because he was successful"". No man, or Woman, needs to have more money then to live the rest of their life comfortably. That's my philosophy on life. Also, I'm not a socialist! ;)"

Text: None","----- The following is taken from my website, which can be found here: http://politicaljoe.net... ---- The idea of gun laws is very similar to Communism believe it or not. Communism at it's idea stage is a very, very great idea. But as with a lot of good ideas, it is often so that the idea is oblivious to the fact that humans are evil. As so, humans will find a way to manipulate that idea to make it a bad system. Communism, again, was one such idea that got screwed over by our inner-evilness. Communism is an extremely complex idea that many have written thousand-page theses on, but I want to focus on one aspect of it, that aspect being how people would work and consume. Communism basically took out money in a sense, and told people to work their hardest at their line of expertise. Then, if you needed anything, you would ask for it, and you would get it. Again, I'd like to state that this is way oversimplified. So for instance, if you were a farmer, you would produce crops your best and give your crops to people who needed it. Conversely, if you needed something, per say a car, (and communism taught not to over consume) you would ask someone who made cars to give you one. This in my opinion, is a great idea as an idea. However, people are evil, and corruption begins. People had to wait months to get car a because of all the under-dealings, and outside of this aspect of Communism, all hell broke loose. This is exactly the same with gun control laws. It predicts that if we make it so hard to get a gun, the bad guys will not be able to get guns, and we all can live under harmony. But we as a race are not quite bunny-sunshine. The bad guys would not just stop being evil, they would just start getting guns from the already hugely existent gun underground. And that underground would grow and grow and what else? Grow. Sort of like illegal immigrants and fake ID's, but that's a totally different story. Take for instance the Temperance Movement. They were a Christian movement in the early 1900s that successfully banned alcohol in the United States of America. They actually got the United States Congress to pass the Eighteenth Amendment of the United States of America, which only got being rejected by Rhode Island. Thank God it was short-lived being repealed thirteen years later by the twenty-first amendment, or else the damage it cause would have been quite multiplied. The Eighteenth Amendment of the United States of America, subsequently created such a massive alcohol underground, run by the Italian Mafia just for your information, that it became a joke to get drunk, thus forcing Congress to repeal it. However, in those thirteen years alcoholism increased fanatically, and countless thousands died due to alcoholism just because a group of Christian women thought it'd be a good idea. And that brings me back to the corruption of ideas. Gun control laws may be a great idea, but looking at historical evidence, it will, and has already become quite corrupted. In fact, according to a Time Magazine article entitled, ""Darkness Falls"" by Nancy Gibbs, 85% of crimes that involve guns are committed with illegally obtained gun. Want more? The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms during the 1990's, reported that only 7% of armed career criminals obtained firearms from licensed gun shops. The simple fact is this. With or without gun control laws, bad guys will always find guns to use, and if they're going to get them anyways, I for one want to arm myself from them. In fact, according to an article entitled ""Recent School Shootings"" published in 1997 by the Washington Post, sixteen-year-old Luke Woodham stabbed his mother to death and then went to school with a rifle where he shot 9 students, killing 2 of them. However, Assistant Principal Joel Myrick raced to his car, retrieved a .45 caliber handgun, and used it to subdue Woodham until police arrived. Imagine how many lives he saved. So, some of you might be asking by now, am I implying that more gun control laws mean more violence, and that less gun control laws means less? No. I'm saying that. According to The National Center for Policy Analysis and safestreetsdc.com, in 1976, Washington, D.C. enacted one of the most restrictive gun control laws in the nation. Since then, the city's murder rate has risen 200% while their population dropped about 15%. It got so bad, D.C. was known as the ""murder capital"" of the United States. Switzerland practices total conscription, and it has one of the lowest crime rates in the world according to a 1996 Switzerland Census and just wide know knowledge. Florida adopted a right-to-carry law in 1987 and between 1987 and 1996, homicide rates dropped 36%, firearm homicide rate dropped 37%, and handgun homicide rate dropped 41%. New Jersey adopted what sponsors described as ""the most stringent gun law"" in the nation in 1966 and two years later, the murder rate was up 46% and the reported robbery rate had nearly doubled. Even using Hitler as an example, when he banned all guns in Germany... well you know what happened. So in conclusion, Gun Control laws, just like Communism and the Eighteenth Amendment, are great ideas as ideas. But humans are evil maniacal beings who love to manipulate. When an idea does not include prevention of evilness in it of itself, the idea will get corrupted. Gun Control laws will be more, but have already been corrupted as evident by all the statistics. So I ask this, why are we adding upon the already 20,000 gun laws we already have in the good ol' US of A?"

Text: None","Modern countries such as Canada and Britan seam to be completely obsessed with disarming their citizens. Being Canadian I find this extremely alarming. Personal defense is a basic human right. If I am attacked by a chainsaw wheeling psycho, I should be allowed to shoot him, but only in self defense. This brings up the fact of criminals total disregard for gun laws. To put it another way, if you want to kill your brother because he has been sleeping with your wife, why would you heed 3 gun laws? Your going to kill someone, some tiny little gun laws wont get in your way. You will to strait ahead after all if you gt caught for murder, a couple illigal gun laws won't seam like such a big deal. Since guns are so hard to acquire, especially hand guns. The majority of Canadian public does not carry a side arm. Imagine for second if every person in Canada was required to carry anside arm at all times. Criminals would think twice before trying to rape you in that back ally while you are taking a piss. Criminals would have to completely rethink their ""plan of attack."" No longer can they just barge into a bank holding all for hostage. Now every person in that bank has a side arm, and is willing to use it. If more people carried weapons, and if our country even let us, then criminals would think again before harming innocents."

Text: None","The first and most basic reason that marijuana should be legal is that there is no good reason for it not to be legal. Some people ask 'why should marijuana be legalized?"" but we should ask ""Why should marijuana be illegal?"" From a philosophical point of view, individuals deserve the right to make choices for themselves. The government only has a right to limit those choices if the individuals actions endanger someone else. This does not apply to marijuana, since the individual who chooses to use marijuana does so according to his or her own free will. The government also may have a right to limit individual actions if the actions pose a significant threat to the individual. But this argument does not logically apply to marijuana because marijuana is far less dangerous than some drugs which are legal, such as alcohol and tobacco The second important reason that marijuana should be legal is that it would save our government lots of money. In the United States, all levels of government (federal, state, and local authorities) participate in the ""War on Drugs."" We currently spend billions of dollars every year to chase peaceful people who happen to like to get high. These people get locked up in prison and the taxpayers have to foot the bill. We have to pay for food, housing, health care, attorney fees, court costs, and other expenses to lock these people up. This is extremely expensive! We could save billions of dollars every year as a nation if we stop wasting money locking people up for having marijuana. In addition, if marijuana were legal, the government would be able to collect taxes on it, and would have a lot more money to pay for effective drug education programs and other important causes. The third major reason that marijuana should be legal is because prohibition does not help the country in any way, and causes a lot of problems. There is no good evidence that prohibition decreases drug use, and there are several theories that suggest prohibition might actually increase drug use (i.e. the ""forbidden fruit"" effect, and easier accessibility for youth). One unintended effect of marijuana prohibition is that marijuana is very popular in American high schools. Why? Because it is available. You don't have to be 21 to buy marijuana -- marijuana dealers usually don't care how old you are as long as you have money. It is actually easier for many high school students to obtain marijuana than it is for them to obtain alcohol, because alcohol is legal and therefore regulated to keep it away from kids. If our goal is to reduce drug consumption, then we should focus on open and honest programs to educate youth, regulation to keep drugs away from kids, and treatment programs for people with drug problems. But the current prohibition scheme does not allow such reasonable approaches to marijuana; instead we are stuck with 'DARE' police officers spreading lies about drugs in schools, and policies that result in jail time rather than treatment for people with drug problems. We tried prohibition with alcohol, and that failed miserably. We should be able to learn our lesson and stop repeating the same mistake There are plenty of other reasons why marijuana should be legal. Just to name a few: Medicinal use: Marijuana can be used as medicine because it helps to stimulate appetite and relieve nausea in cancer and AIDS patients. Hemp: The hemp plant is a valuable natural resource. Legalizing marijuana would eliminate the confusion surrounding hemp and allow us to take advantage of hemp's agricultural and industrial uses. Religious Use:Some religions instruct their followers to use marijuana. Just like Christianity and Judaism instruct their followers to drink wine on certain occaisions, some Hindus, Buddhists, Rastafarians, and members of other religions use marijuana as part of their spiritual and religious ceremonies. These people deserve the freedom to practice their religion as they see fit. The First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution says that the government cannot 'prohibit the free exercise' of religion, and so marijuana should be legal."

Text: None","Ladies and Gentlemen, I will be acting as the prosecutor in this debate and I will be advocating the banning of the user known as ""Imabench"" from DDO for violating the Terms of Service numerous times during his presence on the site. Here are the portions of the TOS that Imabench has violated: - 1) Section C of the code of conduct Imabench has uploaded many pictures that were used against conservative beliefs in debates. He has also uploaded content that is defamatory to politicians and pop culture figures in debates as well. - 2) Section O of the code of conductImabench has mentioned that he has used DDO to try to hit on Thett's sister in real life. - 3) Section T part 1 about the use of profanity. Imabench has said the word f*ck 347 times, sh*t 493 times, dumba** 128 times, and b*tch 77 times which is in blatant violation of the TOS - 4) Section T part 2 Imabench has humorously attacked the opinions of members and members themselves numerous times both in debates and in the forums - 5) Imabench has also been involved in behaviors detrimental to the site which includes but is not limited to - A - Making various sexual remarks in his debates and on the forums, at one point he even explained in detail what a ""Cleveland Steamer"" is to a 13 year old girl on DDO, claimed that 16kadams enjoys deep-throating large black dildo's, and that he tricked his grandmother into watching a video of a girl violating another girl's behind with a ping pong paddle handle. - B - He has trolled and derailed numerous debates which not to get personal is a real a**hole thing for him to do. Once he derailed a debate about there being Poop in DNA and he somehow won even though he in no way should have won that debate.... - C - He unwillingly triggered the Ima incident of 4/28 to 4/29 where 11 multiaccounts were created in his name (kind of) and went around DDO attacking members and calling for Imabench's death - D - He has spammed debates that are beyond stupid, including but not limited to,- ""DDO should have a massive sex orgy if the world ends in 2012""- ""Having 1 testicle is better than having 3 testicles""- ""Women should be given free large breast enhancements""- ""Imabench should be banned for violating the TOS""and numerous others as part of his former ""Weekly Troll debate"" campaignThat being said it has been in the interest of many people that Imabench should be banned from DDO for the reasons mentioned above. I selected to be the one advocating for the banning of myself, and I promise to not let the fact that I am prosecuting myself compromise my handling of this debate as prosecutor. As part of Imabench's demands, Imabench has called on his right to a speedy debate for his banning, thus the debate will be limited to four rounds. Imabench has also requested that the position for defending himself will be open to the public and has waived his right to appoint someone to represent himself. Therefore, whoever accepts this debate will argue on Imabench's behalf.Lastly Imabench has requested that the jury be made up of those who vote on this debate, meaning the final score of this debate will determine if Imabench will be banned or not. I will try my best to show why Imabench should be banned, whoever accepts this debate shall argue why he shouldnt be banned."

Text: None","This debate has 2 parts. First, financial aid is a needed form of aid. Second, gov. is the agent to provide it. As Prop, misunderstanding the debate, has mostly focused on the latter and has dismissed our args regarding the first, we take the first part home and would now like to focus on proving the second part. But first let’s correct some misunderstandings of the Prop. Prop said “gov should establish a service”, “It’s the gov’s duty to enable the objective conditions…THROUGH SERVICES”, yet later they claim that they never said so. Moreover whether Prop’s REPLACING financial aid with services or maintaining current services does not matter, as long as they say gov. should ONLY provide services. B/c providing financial aid has inherent values that can never be obtained through services and therefore should be provided. Prop also ASSUMES increased income gotten by tax breakers will all be turned to charity. Prop is being esp illogical in their 3-type-anaysis. Why would type2&3 donate when they don’t like donation. Wouldn’t they just keep the money for themselves? Now, let’s move on to proving how gov is the agent to provide financial aid. First, gov has an inherent duty to help the poor b/c we no longer live in a pure capitalistic society but in capitalism 4.0 where gov. carries the burden to help the poor. If gov is a rep of society as Prop concedes, and poverty is a social problem, then of course gov as the rep should fix it. Not only does gov have the responsibility but it is also better suited. Prop believes being local, individual and focused are virtues without flaws. However we have clearly shown their prb: 1. Being local means only being concerned with the poor under their jurisdiction. 2. Being individual means only tackling prb on personal levels when clearly larger socioeconomic causes exist for poverty. 3. Being focused means being unable to see the bigger picture. In their headlong quest for helping “their ppl” charities can cause harm to other groups. Charities are without values, but there are some functions that charities can’t serve and therefore have to be served by the gov. Poverty is obviously not just an individual problem. Because gov. has much larger scale of funding, scope and outreach they can tackle poverty on a macro level. As complex procedure is the reason they are able to have such power, we believe bureaucracy is a necessary evil. B/c gov can take into account the overall status of the poor they achieve much more balance distribution of resources. While Prop accuses gov of being ineffective, part of the reason is b/c they take care of so many ppl. Charities provide better service at the cost of entirely neglecting those outside their reach. Therefore gov. is a better suited agent then charity in some areas. And as the two are not mutually exclusive why ban one? Charities, being inside the forest, can only see trees. Let them tend to their trees, but also let gov tend to its forest."

Text: None","As an born bred American Citizen I believe that allowing illegal immigrants into our country then giving them citizenship just like that is beyond wrong especially for those who are currently do the process right so that they may become a legal citizen of the United States. Now I don't want to hate on the Illegal Immigrants due to the fact that being human we strive to live better lives and most of us knowing that the U.S.A even in it's current condition is still very high on the scale for new opportunities, it's just that people have to want it bad enough, I digress but to my point if illegal immigrants were to enter the country it should be only on one term and that is to work. Now people are like oh those illegal are taking our jobs away but in reality if they were to pay attention in life rather than listen down the grape vine they would know that most illegal immigrants take jobs that most Americans wouldn't such as helping farmers pick food, they also pick up trash, and so on. These jobs are looked upon very unfavorably by the tens of millions of Americans. So to end my opinion, I shall state this, Illegal Immigrants under no circumstances should be allowed sanctuary in a country they do not belong to , only and mean only if they have a working visa and are monitored very closely to where they could not just fit into the populous and just disappear. There shall be tight restrictions to what they may do. As for the illegal immigrants that are currently in the country i feel they need to be found and deported to their home countries and be encouraged to become a U.S. citizen but there shall not be any automatic citizenship. You cannot just be forgiven and be granted something that you haven't earned. Only those that follow the rules shall get access and sometimes they don't even fit the standards."

Text: None","While this site may purport to support controversy and discussion of relevant social issues, and total trivia in some cases such as who's cuter than who or which comic book character is tougher, when pressed it is just as capable of bias and cowardice as any other privately owned expression media. http://www.debate.org... ...was removed because of a heated debate that developed on the nature of the typical American mating paradigm of sexual and economical objectification of females and males respectively. Subjective excuses about manners or cursing will likely be used to defend this action, or maybe a heavy handed ""it's mine I can do as I please"" from the owner. But the fact is no one wants to hear about the evolutionary dead end we've gotten ourselves into, and this site, like any other, will suppress truly unpopular ideas rather than allow them to be explored unless that exploration is watered down and meaningless. Free speech is not possible on any server hosted in the united states."

As Prop, misunderstanding the debate, has mostly focused on the latter and has dismissed our args regarding the first, we take the first part home and would now like to focus on proving the second part. But first let’s correct some misunderstandings of the Prop. Prop said “gov should establish a service”, “It’s the gov’s duty to enable the objective conditions…THROUGH SERVICES”, yet later they claim that they never said so. Moreover whether Prop’s REPLACING financial aid with services or maintaining current services does not matter, as long as they say gov. should ONLY provide services. B/c providing financial aid has inherent values that can never be obtained through services and therefore should be provided. Prop also ASSUMES increased income gotten by tax breakers will all be turned to charity. Prop is being esp illogical in their 3-type-anaysis. Why would type2&3 donate when they don’t like donation. Wouldn’t they just keep the money for themselves? Now, let’s move on to proving how gov is the agent to provide financial aid. First, gov has an inherent duty to help the poor b/c we no longer live in a pure capitalistic society but in capitalism 4.0 where gov. carries the burden to help the poor. If gov is a rep of society as Prop concedes, and poverty is a social problem, then of course gov as the rep should fix it. Not only does gov have the responsibility but it is also better suited. Prop believes being local, individual and focused are virtues without flaws. However we have clearly shown their prb: 1. Being local means only being concerned with the poor under their jurisdiction. 2. Being individual means only tackling prb on personal levels when clearly larger socioeconomic causes exist for poverty. 3. Being focused means being unable to see the bigger picture. In their headlong quest for helping “their ppl” charities can cause harm to other groups. Charities are without values, but there are some functions that charities can’t serve and therefore have to be served by the gov. Poverty is obviously not just an individual problem. Because gov. has much larger scale of funding, scope and outreach they can tackle poverty on a macro level. As complex procedure is the reason they are able to have such power, we believe bureaucracy is a necessary evil. B/c gov can take into account the overall status of the poor they achieve much more balance distribution of resources. While Prop accuses gov of being ineffective, part of the reason is b/c they take care of so many ppl. Charities provide better service at the cost of entirely neglecting those outside their reach. Therefore gov. is a better suited agent then charity in some areas. And as the two are not mutually exclusive why ban one? Charities, being inside the forest, can only see trees. Let them tend to their trees, but also let gov tend to its forest."

Text: None","To avoid teaching maths to children just because they don’t like the subject would be to shape the education system around adolescent whims. But children are not best placed to put a value on their education. They don’t know what knowledge is required for life and what skills are required for a career. They are likely to choose arbitrarily, influenced perhaps by which teachers are most strict, which subject they happen to be good at and what mood they’re in. It is for this reason that we don’t recognise children as being fully capable of making decisions about their education. Consequences of this include a government-fixed curriculum. Adults know the value of maths: one poll in America found that 34% of people named it as the most valuable subject they had studied at school.[1] We think children should be learning maths, and it follows that they will have to do it, like it or not.

At present, both countries have strong currencies, with the Swiss Franc a major international reserve currency in its own right. Through the Krone and Franc they can control their own monetary policy to suit economic conditions. By contrast, small EU states are at the mercy of the European Central Bank, having to endure interest rates that may be right for Germany or France, but which are too tight or too loose for Ireland or Belgium. This explains why EU countries such as Denmark and the UK have so far refused to join the Euro. Norway and Switzerland may also wonder whether they want to yoke themselves to profligate debtor countries like Italy, Greece, whose falling credit ratings are placing monetary union under strain at present.

The US faces no such threat for non-compliance and thus makes a show of its leverage over the UN. Such an attitude potentially undermines the desire of other nations to be receptive to serious US needs, resolutions and reforms.   The US therefore needs to be very careful when exercising its power in the UN and deciding how much money to set apart; otherwise countries may start to question the role and importance of such a big international organization. improve this  "

Text: None","For three reasons, I feel that having universal and publicly funded health care in America would not only be detrimental to our economy and our national beliefs, but it would not be efective, and would only harm Americans: 1. There isn't a single government agency or division that runs efficiently; do we really want an organization that developed the U.S. Tax Code handling something as complex as health care? 2. Like social security, any government benefit eventually is taken as a ""right"" by the public, meaning that it's politically near impossible to remove or curtail it later on when costs get out of control. 3. Patients aren't likely to curb their drug costs and doctor visits if health care is free; thus, total costs will be several times what they are now. I would like to begin this debate with a quote by a presonal favorite of mine, ecnomist Milton Friedman ""History suggests that capitalism is a necessary condition for political freedom"". My first point, being that there isn't a single government agency or division that runs efficiently; do we really want an organization that developed the U.S. Tax Code handling something as complex as health care? There isn't a single government office that squeezes efficiency out of every dollar the way the private sector can. How about the U.S. income tax system? When originally implemented, it collected 1 percent from the highest income citizens. Look at it today. A few years back to government published a ""Tax Simplification Guide"", and the guide itself was over 1,000 pages long! This is what happens when politicians mess with something that should be simple.Think about the Department of Motor Vehicles. This isn't rocket science--they have to keep track of licenses and basic database information for state residents. However, the costs to support the department are enormous, and when was the last time you went to the DMV and didn't have to stand in a long line? If it can't handle things this simple, how can we expect the government to handle all the complex nuances of the medical system? My second point deals with how if we go through with public health care, it will become premanent just like social security turned out to be. Dr. Friedman also once said, ""Nothing is so permanent as a temporary government program."" Social security was originally put in place to help seniors live the last few years of their lives; however, the retirement age of 65 was set when average life spans were dramatically shorter. Now that people are regular living into their 90s or longer, costs are skyrocketing out of control, making the program unsustainable. Despite the fact that all politicians know the system is heading for bankruptcy in a couple decades, no one is rushing to fix it. When President Bush tried to re-structure it with private accounts, the Democrats ran a scare campaign about Bush's intention to ""take away your social security"". Even though he promised no change in benefits, the fact that he was proposing change at all was enough to kill the effort, despite the fact that Democrats offered zero alternative plan to fix it. Despite Republican control of the presidency and both houses, Bush was not even close to having the political support to fix something that has to be fixed ASAP; politicians simply didn't want to risk their re-elections. The same pattern is true with virtually all government spending programs. Do you think politicians will ever be able to cut education spending or unemployment insurance? Only if they have a political death wish. In time, the same would be true of universal health care spending. As costs skyrocket because of government inefficiency and an aging population, politicians will never be able to re-structure the system, remove benefits, or put private practice options back in the system…that is, unless they want to give up hope of re-election. With record debt levels already in place, we can't afford to put in another ""untouchable"" spending program, especially one with the capacity to easily pass defense and social security in cost. And now my third and final point states that patients aren't likely to curb their drug costs and doctor visits if health care is free; thus, total costs will be several times what they are now. Co-pays and deductibles were put in place because there are medical problems that are more minor annoyances than anything else. Sure, it would be nice if we had the medical staff and resources to treat every ache and pain experienced by an American, but we don't. For example, what if a patient is having trouble sleeping? What if a patient has a minor cold, flu, or headache? There are scores of problems that we wouldn't go to a doctor to solve if he had to pay for it; however, if everything is free, why not go? The result is that doctors must spend more time on non-critical care, and the patients that really need immediate help must wait. In fact, for a number of problems, it's better if no medical care is given whatsoever. The body's immune system is designed to fight off infections and other illnesses. It becomes stronger when it can fight things off on its own. Treating the symptoms can prolong the underlying problem, in addition to the societal side effects such as the growing antibiotic resistance of certain infections. In closing, by establishing free and universal health-care, we will drastically hurt our economy, everything our nation stands for, and it may also harm our actual health, doing the exact opposite thing it tried to do. Thank you."

Text: None","Let’s be honest; European Union elections are hardly exciting and certainly not the most obvious elections to start young people off with. The votes are on very broad issues that don’t have a direct impact on the individual such as trade agreements or broad brush environmental legislation such as the carbon trading market. These may be important issues but they are also abstract and removed from the lives of voters. As Professor Cees Van der Eijk argues ""the media pays very little attention to European elections. EU actors are generally invisible, and the elections are labelled boring even before they take place"".[1] To make matters worse each individual vote is worth much less in European than national elections making it more difficult to explain why the individual should vote. In Germany there are more than six times more Bundestag members than there are Germany MEPs.[2] By starting young people out on ‘boring’ elections that are about people and institutions they will never have heard of and have little relevance to young people’s daily lives lowering the voting age would be damaging to turn out.

Text: None","How can it be okay for a broadcaster, funded by a compulsory levy on anyone who owns a television, to willingly produce programmes they know will cause offence to that consumer? The charge of blasphemy is far more than saying ‘I didn’t enjoy this’ or ‘not my kind of show’, it is a deeply held belief that what has been said is a deliberate and willful attack on values and beliefs that the viewer holds sacred and fundamental to who they are. All major broadcasters, including the BBC, routinely test shows and monitor audience response and yet, in this particular regard, feel relaxed about producing material that certain viewers would consider it not only uncomfortable but sinful to watch. By definition, those viewers cannot watch those shows or, quite probably, that station and yet they are still expected to pay for it. Even if a British viewer were to choose never to watch the BBC again because of the offence caused by programmes such as Jerry Springer: The Opera, they would still be paying the salaries of those who had caused the offence in the first place. That cannot be reasonable by any standard."

Text: None","High taxes act as a disincentive to entrepreneurs it separates people from the fruits of their labour. Often new ventures are started at great financial risk by the founder and excessive taxation can skew the risk/reward ratio to the point where the enterprise is no longer worth the bother. In the business case, companies need to accumulate capital in order to expand their operations or break in to new markets and maintain working capital to cover the expenses of their day-to-day business activities. Forcing a business to go into or maintain a debt due to tax incurs a cost to the business and ultimately results in a less stable and/or competitive business. History has shown repeatedly that private enterprise is a more efficient allocator of assets than the government, as private enterprise takes in to account the relative cost of any action, reduced down to monetary terms (the profit motive). This is not to say that taxes and government are unnecessary, as non-revenue generating infrastructure is required to be built and maintained in order to facilitate modern life. But when the burden of taxation begins to affect and retard economic enterprise, society as a whole loses out."

Text: None","Result and process are two fundamentals when one is pursuing a goal. However, People tend to weigh these two differently. While the result gives us guidance and inspiration, The process makes sure we go through the journey and learn along the way so that we can have more experience. I believe one should be more process-oriented than caring so much about the result. Whether the result is good or not, Experiencing or actually enjoying the process is always valuable. For example, This February I went to a ""business hack-a-thon"" and I was very excited the night before because that is what I always really wanted to do, And I felt confident that I should and I could win this. However, During the hack-a-thon, As I reviewed what other teams had as their projects and their ideas, I gradually noticed that my team was not the best one. I was struck because I wanted to win so badly at the time, I continued to work hard with my team only for the purpose of achieving a victorious result, Without much regard for the process. It was finally our pitching time and the judging round. My team didn""t do very well and obviously, The result ended up with us losing. I was floored because in the very beginning I thought we could win and I was so excited about this, But later, I realized that as the hackathon was progressing, I started to gradually ignore the fact that I decided to enter the hackathon because I wanted to learn more and see how other people were doing and just simply to spend more time with my friends. Later, I reflected on myself and learned that I should just enjoy the hackathon and not to be so single-minded about winning, Because it was also a great experience of learning overall when I think back. Nowadays in society, People are drastically more result-oriented a lot of times because they are ambitious and really want to achieve some goals. How they care about the result can inspire and really encourage them by making them see the great future when they succeed. However, The problem appears ""when we become obsessed with the results we want and forget about the process that will get us there"", The thing that initially motivated us to take action, Said by SJ. Scott from Success Habits. The process is what first gets one inspired to start doing something valuable. While during the process, They will be attracted by the result more because of their increasing ambition as they do more. This is important because everyone can relate, And people always face this kind of problem between focusing more on the process or the result every day. Being process-oriented is better because when you focus on the process, The result will be automatically as fantastic as one expected initially and plus the experience is important as well. Thanks."

Text: None","I have always felt that the arguement against vegetarianism were never sufficient and could have been much better. The arguement against vegetarianism was mostly taken up by fools who love mcdonalds too much and let their stomach's decide their principles thats why I felt it neccesary to publish my thoughts on the issue. I will be arguing on grounds of health, food shortages, morality and also a religous perspective.Firstly, I understand that the arguments given proclaiming that a life of vegitarianism leads to a lack of protein and well balanced diet are defunct as humans generally overconsume protein and unless you go out to the gym for a couple of hours a day most protein consumption ends up converted into fat. However a vegitarian lifestyle can lead to serious iron defiencies which can lead to serious health problems in the future, and for those who say just use suppliments, suppliments generally don't work as you consume large dosages in a unnatural way your body can't process it and it just ends up as expensive urine. Furthermore many people argue meat is generally bad for you because it is high in fat, this is a common misnomer as most fat that you consume is from it being cooked in oil. Also meat has far less fat naturally than most dairy products of which one would have to rely on heavily to remain a vegitarian.Secondly, vegitarians often say that the meat industry force breeds animals and feeds them with disportional numbers of crops compared to the food provided with the animal if we banned meat consumption it would help massively with world hunger problems. I would respond to this by saying this may be true for the western world but the for the majority of developing nations of which is the majority of the worlds population these people rely on the local community and infrastructure rather than the global meat market. These people largely rely on the growing and slaughtering of animals not only as a large part of the local economy but to feed their children as these people don't have quorn mince and vegitarian meals not consuming meat for them would cause significant mal nutrition, as the only no meat they would consume would be rice wheat and the odd vegitable these people don't purchase neccesities from a nearby walmart and buy frozen sloppy joes they buy all goods from their local arket of which is all produced locally. Not only would banning meat for them not only hurt the local economy but it world worsen the problem of world hunger and malnutrition.Thirdly, the entire premise of the morality behind vegitarianism is the assuption that life inherently has value. However if you are not religous that is entirely ilogical. If the universe was a happy accident from pure chance along with the earth and through natural selection the species of the earth evolved leaving us with the contempary world, life has no inherent meaning and is valueless. People commonly say that even though its through chance I still enjoy things I still experience emotion, sadness and joy this gives it value. I would reply but you believe such experience and emotions are just chemicals in your brain and are just telling you to like things, to refrain from things to eat and to drink and only because they were the optimal things for you to survive as species without this hightened sense of morality were more likely to be wiped out as ultimate division and lack of morality towards other in the species would help drive it to exstinction. How could one who is irreligous say that life has meaning and it is wrong to eat meat as you are killing something that still has a significant awareness. Surely that is no premise to say that is immoral as surely if you are irreligous there is no morality as they these are delusional perceptions created by natural selection in order for us to survive easier. Finally, if you are a christian like me there are many quotes in the bible saying that the world and everything in it is a gift from God to us and likewise."

Text: None","| My previous attempt at putting this up was reply-bombed by somebody who ""accidentally"" entered the debate without any intension of competing. | Right. Keep in mind, when I say 'rights', I mean the sort of thing, like, the right to work, the right to travel. Those sort of things aren't rights. Rights are things that are unnaturally imposed on others for ""humanitarian"" purposes, which has no basis on reality. This isn't a matter of freedom, either. It's a matter of what's good for this country. We nearly lost the election over those dumb voting chicks who ""Went With Hillary"". We can't afford to let America rot from the inside out just because the majority of dumb, liberal women vote for the next 'Woman For President'. Because it's not about who runs, or what their experience is, or how they'll improve America. It's about the image. The idea. The spectacle. It's all a lie, a fabrication. In Austria, a far-right nationalist candidate lost over a far left feminist candidate. This wasn't a democratic election, as they had to purposely bring in foreign voters just to prevent him from winning. It wasn't moral or just, and this is just proof of that. https://youtu.be... http://www.dailystormer.com...... Women should not be able to vote. They shouldn't have ever gained that ability, but we became soft as a people and allowed this to happen. Now, they're tearing up the democratic system, always, ALWAYS voting left. ALWAYS voting Democrat. Always. They can't think ahead. It's inherent in their biology. It's not such a bad trait, but women are quickly trying to do things that they simply can't. They cannot grasp what's good for a country, and they can't think strategically (despite what the US Army wants you to think!). My views are very simple, in that I feel that women should not be able to vote, should stay at home, and need to take care of their children. Men cannot raise children on their own, and neither can a woman. But there's a delicate balance between both that needs to be nurtured, grown, for the child to be successful. They need to be told 'no'. They need discipline. They also need a father figure to look up to, and in turn, a mother figure. They need proper idols that don't obsess over sex, or openly do degenerate actions or things that turn them into unhealthy adults without inhibition and self control. That's what this generation is lacking. A good moral compass and self control. And every day that we don't enforce these things that I've pointed out, will only lead to further woodrot within the system. As long as we forget where our roots lay, and where we need to go as a society and as a people, we'll always be lost, easy to tamper with and to warp to others' needs. Women are at the heart of the next generation. They bear the seed and give birth to their children. It's in everyone's best interests that they do not forget about their sole duty to mankind, to reproduce. We cannot allow ourselves to go extinct over gambling and silly notions of 'Women's Rights' and 'Feminism'. Egalitarianism is for the weak and stupid. Further more, I'd like to note that while feminism is taking it's last breaths in America, the cancer it is, is alive and well in Europe, pushing nationalism to the far back of the spectrum. I'd like to emphasize this, again. Egalitarianism is a Marxist idea that leads to cultural dissonance and chaos. It was made by the Marxist to poison the youth' minds. Feminism is just Egalitarianism with a hint of female superiority complex. By saying all this, I do not mean to say that I ""hate women"", or that I disrespect them in any way. They have their harmless charms, but in the end should stick to that, and only that. Rules: No personal attacks. Keep it civil. Make each reply short and concise, for easy reading. Try to look at things from the other person's viewpoint. Sometimes, people can be right, even if you personally disagree with them. Let the games begin."

May 2002: ""The Israeli governments have implemented a consistent and systematic policy intended to encourage Jewish citizens to migrate to the West Bank. One of the tools used to this end is to grant financial benefits and incentives to citizens - both directly and through the Jewish local authorities. The purpose of this support is to raise the standard of living of these citizens and to encourage migration to the West Bank."" It is difficult, therefore, for Israelis to say that the ""natural expansion"" of settlements is justified and should remain into the future. There is nothing ""natural"" about the growth of Israeli settlements; it has been directly encouraged by the state. All future requests to allow the ""natural growth"" of such settlements should, therefore, be met with significant skepticism and doubt."

Many families, particularly in countries with little welfare, need their children to bring income into the household. Working at an earlier age can help these families to survive. Furthermore, anyone who is having difficulties getting educational qualifications can gain an advantage by leaving school and gaining work experience. If they are forced to stay in school then they will simply lose two years. The British government recognized this and introduced 21 000 extra apprenticeships in 2009. This was an attempt to make sure that those who are not suited to school learning do not fall behind when it comes to finding a job and a sustainable income. [12]"

Text: None","In numerous cases it has been seen that many murders were committed by people who were suffering from various mental or emotional problems. Tormented childhood, improper upbringing etc are some of the reasons responsible for these convicts to act in such away. What is expected from us humans is again a ""humane approach"" to help these people. Proper medical facilities etc can be very helpful in these cases instead of just bringing their life to a dead end. There have been numerous convicts who've pursued their degrees from the prison and later have contributed to the building and development of the society as proved before. So the point which we the opposition is remonstrating is that many a times the person who is found guilty of an act may actually be innocent. What is needed is, that one chance to be given to the person. That one chance to improve upon the mistakes that were done before. That one chance to welcome a positive change which will help in SAVING a life. To further prove it that’s its society will for such a move is like there are like almost 10000 petition written to USA President to remove the Code Of Criminal Procedure that after serving the sentence of murder in the prison the person should be left on parole after he or she is deemed fit to be a part of the society again. For that matter even social networking sites such as orkut and facebook have groups and community to support the same. This proves completely the point that it’s the will of the people who wanted change in system unlike the proposition who still don’t accept change"

Text: None","In most people’s lives there are instances where they might like to react to a situation with a level of aggression. However, owing to a number of reasons such a solution is often impossible and undesirable. It has been theorised by psychologists that pent up frustrations with the world are the root of many psychological problems. Given that this is true then, an outlet for frustrations is required in society such that aggressive behaviour in individuals can be avoided. Video games in this situation provide such an outlet for aggression and frustrations. Firstly aggression is dealt with through the simple act of defeating enemies within games and frustration is dealt with through the completion of goals within the video games, allowing players a sense of satisfaction upon their completion. Hence, one could argue that this may result in comparatively lower levels of aggressive behaviour among video game players. This is supported by research conducted by Dr. Cheryl Olson and her team at Harvard. Studying a sample of 1,254 students aged 12 to 14 years, she found that over 49% of boys and 25% of girls reported using violent games such as Grand Theft Auto IV as an outlet for their anger. She suggests that instead of a blanket ban on M-rated game use by young adolescents, parents should monitor how much time children spend playing games and how they react to specific game content.[1] [1] Olson, Cheryl K., et al., ‘Factors Correlated with Violent Video Game Use by Adolescent Boys and Girls’, Journal of Adolescent Health, Vol.41 no.1, pp77-83, July 2007, http://www.jahonline.org/article/S1054-139X(07)00027-4/abstract"

She suggests that instead of a blanket ban on M-rated game use by young adolescents, parents should monitor how much time children spend playing games and how they react to specific game content.[1] [1] Olson, Cheryl K., et al., ‘Factors Correlated with Violent Video Game Use by Adolescent Boys and Girls’, Journal of Adolescent Health, Vol.41 no.1, pp77-83, July 2007, http://www.jahonline.org/article/S1054-139X(07)00027-4/abstract"

Text: None","Lets start with the mental aspect, golf is mentally draining. U have to constantly think about what will happen if u hit the ball too far or too short, or too much right or left. U have to be mentally strong to win and u have virtually no help. Only in golf do u have to hit between trees, off of twigs dirt, rocks, etc... U have to be able to create opportunity where it seems to be none. The skill aspect is is easily shown, the amount of skill it takes to battle the natural challenges, put together with bunkers and water hazards and anything else placed to make the course hard. Only in golf do you have to worry about if u hit the ball two yards too far, its in the bunker or water. Golf as a whole is just a demanding sport and requires the most mentally, skill wise and creativity."

Text: None","These are my top 10 reasons on why marijuana should be legalized. 10. Prohibition has failed to control the use and domestic production of marijuana. The government has tried to use criminal penalties to prevent marijuana use for over 75 years and yet: marijuana is now used by over 25 million people annually, cannabis is currently the largest cash crop in the United States, and marijuana is grown all over the planet. Claims that marijuana prohibition is a successful policy are ludicrous and unsupported by the facts, and the idea that marijuana will soon be eliminated from America and the rest of the world is a ridiculous fantasy. 9. Arrests for marijuana possession disproportionately affect blacks and Hispanics and reinforce the perception that law enforcement is biased and prejudiced against minorities. African-Americans account for approximately 13% of the population of the United States and about 13.5% of annual marijuana users, however, blacks also account for 26% of all marijuana arrests. Recent studies have demonstrated that blacks and Hispanics account for the majority of marijuana possession arrests in New York City, primarily for smoking marijuana in public view. Law enforcement has failed to demonstrate that marijuana laws can be enforced fairly without regard to race; far too often minorities are arrested for marijuana use while white/non-Hispanic Americans face a much lower risk of arrest. 8. A regulated, legal market in marijuana would reduce marijuana sales and use among teenagers, as well as reduce their exposure to other drugs in the illegal market. The illegality of marijuana makes it more valuable than if it were legal, providing opportunities for teenagers to make easy money selling it to their friends. If the excessive profits for marijuana sales were ended through legalization there would be less incentive for teens to sell it to one another. Teenage use of alcohol and tobacco remain serious public health problems even though those drugs are legal for adults, however, the availability of alcohol and tobacco is not made even more widespread by providing kids with economic incentives to sell either one to their friends and peers. 7. Legalized marijuana would reduce the flow of money from the American economy to international criminal gangs. Marijuana's illegality makes foreign cultivation and smuggling to the United States extremely profitable, sending billions of dollars overseas in an underground economy while diverting funds from productive economic development. 6. Marijuana's legalization would simplify the development of hemp as a valuable and diverse agricultural crop in the United States, including its development as a new bio-fuel to reduce carbon emissions. Canada and European countries have managed to support legal hemp cultivation without legalizing marijuana, but in the United States opposition to legal marijuana remains the biggest obstacle to development of industrial hemp as a valuable agricultural commodity. As US energy policy continues to embrace and promote the development of bio-fuels as an alternative to oil dependency and a way to reduce carbon emissions, it is all the more important to develop industrial hemp as a bio-fuel source - especially since use of hemp stalks as a fuel source will not increase demand and prices for food, such as corn. Legalization of marijuana will greatly simplify the regulatory burden on prospective hemp cultivation in the United States. 5. Prohibition is based on lies and disinformation. Justification of marijuana's illegality increasingly requires distortions and selective uses of the scientific record, causing harm to the credibility of teachers, law enforcement officials, and scientists throughout the country. The dangers of marijuana use have been exaggerated for almost a century and the modern scientific record does not support the reefer madness predictions of the past and present. Many claims of marijuana's danger are based on old 20th century prejudices that originated in a time when science was uncertain how marijuana produced its characteristic effects. Since the cannabinoid receptor system was discovered in the late 1980s these hysterical concerns about marijuana's dangerousness have not been confirmed with modern research. Everyone agrees that marijuana, or any other drug use such as alcohol or tobacco use, is not for children. Nonetheless, adults have demonstrated over the last several decades that marijuana can be used moderately without harmful impacts to the individual or society. 4. Marijuana is not a lethal drug and is safer than alcohol. It is established scientific fact that marijuana is not toxic to humans; marijuana overdoses are nearly impossible, and marijuana is not nearly as addictive as alcohol or tobacco. It is unfair and unjust to treat marijuana users more harshly under the law than the users of alcohol or tobacco. 3. Marijuana is too expensive for our justice system and should instead be taxed to support beneficial government programs. Law enforcement has more important responsibilities than arresting 750,000 individuals a year for marijuana possession, especially given the additional justice costs of disposing of each of these cases. Marijuana arrests make justice more expensive and less efficient in the United States, wasting jail space, clogging up court systems, and diverting time of police, attorneys, judges, and corrections officials away from violent crime, the sexual abuse of children, and terrorism. Furthermore, taxation of marijuana can provide needed and generous funding of many important criminal justice and social programs. 2. Marijuana use has positive attributes, such as its medical value and use as a recreational drug with relatively mild side effects. Many people use marijuana because they have made an informed decision that it is good for them, especially Americans suffering from a variety of serious ailments. Marijuana provides relief from pain, nausea, spasticity, and other symptoms for many individuals who have not been treated successfully with conventional medications. Many American adults prefer marijuana to the use of alcohol as a mild and moderate way to relax. Americans use marijuana because they choose to, and one of the reasons for that choice is their personal observation that the drug has a relatively low dependence liability and easy-to-manage side effects. Most marijuana users develop tolerance to many of marijuana's side effects, and those who do not, choose to stop using the drug. Marijuana use is the result of informed consent in which individuals have decided that the benefits of use outweigh the risks, especially since, for most Americans, the greatest risk of using marijuana is the relatively low risk of arrest. 1. Marijuana users are determined to stand up to the injustice of marijuana probation and accomplish legalization, no matter how long or what it takes to succeed. Despite the threat of arrests and a variety of other punishments and sanctions marijuana users have persisted in their support for legalization for over a generation. They refuse to give up their long quest for justice because they believe in the fundamental values of American society. Prohibition has failed to silence marijuana users despite its best attempts over the last generation. The issue of marijuana's legalization is a persistent issue that, like marijuana, will simply not go away. Marijuana will be legalized because marijuana users will continue to fight for it until they succeed."

Text: None","In the year 1920 alcohol was banned in the United States by the Eighteenth Amendment to the Constitution. However, this ban was later repealed by the Twenty First Amendment. Why? One, because the ban targeted the working class and was therefore unfair, two if one knew were to get it one could buy alcohol illicitly, and three too many people were going to jail for possession of alcohol. The same thing is happening with marijuana. According to the FBI""s Uniform Crime Report for 2011, over 750,000 arrests for marijuana occurred last year. That is about 2054 arrests per day in the U.S alone and 87 percent of those arrests were just for possession. If the United States legalized marijuana, a major part of the Mexican drug trade would be stopped, local dealers would go out of business and otherwise good citizens would not go to jail for the possession of marijuana."

The reason that minimum wage was first introduced was because of companies taking advantage of it employees. They did this by paying them incredibly low wages. Since they made so little money, they had very little to spend on other things but food. However, with the minimum wage, they could earn a little more than bare minimum. 2.

Text: None","we should allow it because on balance it's better for more people who benefit, than from any negative aspects of a minimum wage law. we know the minimum wage accomplishes its objective... because people are paid the wage. every time there's a minimum, that is what employers would pay. and, when the wage is set, it affects not jsut those at the minimum,but those closer to it, especially those who start out there and increase. we shouldn't worry about inflation too much. if the relative few who get minimum cause some inflation... it will only be partial inflation, not full true inflation. full true inflation is where you increase everyone's wages and everything cost wise goes up etc... a pointless endeavor. but here with teh wage, those few will cause only some overall inflation and their benefit will not be fully or significantly offset by costs etc elsewhere given those on the wage are relatively few. we shoudl require the wage, because on balance it helps more than it hurts, wage earner wise. sure, some people will not be hired bcause Joe A couldn't pay him two dolloars an hour, what he was maximum willing to pay. but, we should't cater to that relatively rarer exception... and could even make some common sense exceptions for certain circumstances. on whole, we have the mcdonaldization of america, millions make the wage who wouldn't, compared to a few who aren't hired because of the wage. consider if we have 5% unemployment... a lower wage if we're lucky might drop it a point or two, as the rest aren't employable at all.... but we'd have many many times that being paid less than what they should be, the minimum. on balance more benefit with the wage there's some who argue against the wage as a matter of inherent liberty... but i simply disagree. [side rant... also, the poor have a right to a certain stake of our resources... you can't deny a man from picking apples from a tree in the natural world... no one can claim a tree when they have millions of trees etc. perhaps we could find another way to provide for the poor, but as it exists now... this is the most direct and economical way... and asks from those who surely have, to share a portion, when they are trying to get even more resources etc. it's not like we're asking them to provide every gov benefit in the book. etc"

Text: None","Hey Michael—and once again I would like to challenge you to another debate on debate. org. Definition Death Penalty: death as punishment for a crime called also capital punishment . http://dictionary.reference.com... Should: must; ought . http://dictionary.reference.com... Illegal: Forbidden by law or statute . http://dictionary.reference.com... Overview This debate will be about the death penalty. I shall be con saying that the death penalty should be illegal, for it is immoral. Pro will rebuttal and give statements on how the death penalty should be legal and that we should continue executing prisoners. The death penalty is rather pointless in my opinion because it costs us more money than the life sentence. The death penalty—does it bring back the victim? No it doesn’t. The death penalty rather than showing us to not perpetrate heinous crimes—shows that us Americans kill one another. Structure of the Debate Round 1: Introductions, and first arguments for Con. Pro will show his rebuttals to my arguments and give his own arguments Round 2: Con will argue back and give more reasons. Pro will rebuttal to Con’s claims and give his arguments again. Round 3: Same as round 2 Round 4: Rebuttal, and give your own personal reasons why the death penalty should be illegal or legal. (for both Pro and Con. ) Round 5: Conclusion. Arguments The Death Penalty is a waste of money The death penalty is a pointless way to punish criminals in many ways. Rather than spend 137 million dollars a year on executing criminals, we should just put them into a life sentence. As said earlier—137 million dollars a year is on executing criminals, but however putting them in a life-sentence will cost only around 11.5 million dollars a year. Life sentence can just be as agonizing as having the death sentence. Death sentence basically means that they kill the criminals, but having a life sentence means that they let the criminals rot in jail until they die. . http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org... The Death Penalty is considered cruel and unusual The United States constitution prevents Americans from being killed in a cruel and unusual manner. Whether or not it’s a decapitation, electric chair, gas chamber, or lethal injection—it’s barbaric to allow state-sanctioned murder in a crowd of people. There’s no point in watching one being killed in an audience, so to say. My belief is that it’s unusual for American’s to be watching an execution happening in jail. The Death Penalty could’ve killed innocent lives The third argument in which I will provide states that “The Death Penalty could’ve killed innocent lives. ” For example—Donald Paradis was sentence to death row in the 1980s for the assumption of him killing two people. After 21 years of hard work from his lawyers—they proved that Donald Paradis actually did not kill the two people—rather he hid the bodies into another place. In this website in which I will provide—it states that they saved approximately 12 innocent people from death row. . 12 people that might’ve been killed for no exact reason—other than perjury from the jury. . http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org... In conclusion—the death penalty is pointless, immoral, and a waste of money."

Text: None","Many child performers would undoubtedly protest if their right to perform were taken away from them, and justly so. This can be seen in quotes from the likes of Roddy McDowall, who said in an interview in 1963 that he “had a particularly wonderful time” as a child actor,[1] and would presumably have been quite upset had a ban been enforced in his lifetime. It is beyond the rights of the government to make illegal an opportunity that allows those talented on the stage, in front of a camera, on the pitch, etc. (who might well not be so strong in other, e.g., academic, areas) to make a living from doing what they do best. Some child performers have also proved to be extremely business savvy – the ‘Olsen Twins’ have built a massive industry off of their Disney stardom. [1] BBC News. ‘Actor McDowall dies aged 70"

Text: None","I am interested in the topic at hand. I wish to debate it only for an exchange of opinion so in the end I can come to a conclusion based upon rationality. Con's Contentions; Parents should be forced to contribute at least an average of $24,000 a year for 4 years towards their child's higher education needs, This would be per child. I understand there are a lot of scenario's as to why a child may not receive money towards a higher education. The child is then left with a couple options, military, scholarships if they do well in school or they can choose to go to a community college if they choose to obtain a higher level of education. My arguments are debated below. Argument; 1. ) The average adult begins their college education at the age of 18 or 19, this is generally some time after the completion of high school. If a parent saves $5,400 per year for 18 years, they would accumulate $97,200. This would be sufficient to pay for the average higher education fee of about $24,000 per year, $96,000 for 4 years. -Let us use a fictional character named Jimmy. Jimmy works a construction job full time (40 hrs a week) making $13.00 an hour. Jimmy is a single dad who resides in California. He then decides that he would like to adopt a child, he knows that he will have to contribute $5,400 a year to their child's higher education. Jimmy's annual salary is $24,960. When I had lived in California my rent for a 2 bedroom 1 bathroom house was $700, utilities usually would be $300. So we will go on to assume that Jimmy pays $1,000 a month for housing. This then leaves Jimmy with $7,560 a year. Between my wife and I, we consume $400 a month on food. Annual rate is $4,800, we will assume Jimmy uses the same amount on himself and his child. This leaves Jimmy with $2,760 a year. A. ) ""The median household income in the United States is $46,326. Here in California people have a hard time understanding that yes, 50 percent of our population live on $46,000 or less a year. Dual earner households have a higher median income at $67,348. "" It is apparent that some one making a below average income is capable of paying for their child's higher education. Now you ask your self, why would any one want to work their butt off only to pay for some one elses well being? The answer is essentially an opinion, maybe the joys of having a child supersedes their will to own all the cool ""Knick Knacks"". 2. ) What would this do for our families, our society, and our nation as a whole? If Jimmy's parents had paid for his education. Jimmy would not have student loan debt, Jimmy then could pay for his child's education so on and so forth. B. ) The average student amasses over $20,000 in student debt toward their first degree. This being true the $96,000 Jimmy had saved for his child to go to school would eliminate this debt. I am no expert in this field, but wouldn't eliminate student debt keep money flowing in the economy & essentially keep it growing? Not only that but Americans would not have to fear living a life in debt. 3. ) C. ) Let us take a look at our national debt; $13,736,959,182,346.04 (13 Trillion) ""The estimated population of the United States is 309,464,240 so each citizen's share of this debt is $44,389.49. "" After looking at these statistics & reviewing the average students debt after a higher education, its apparent that student debt is a large contributing factor to this nations overall debt. What If your parents do not want to pay for your education? It is called scholarships, work hard & be rewarded. Military, serve your country and you will reek the benefits of the GI Bill. 4. ) Finally let us take a look at the fact that different levels of education will cost various amounts. Those that require much more money than an average higher education should be allowed to take student loans. This is as long as they are on track to graduate, and their profession should allow them to pay back their loans quickly & offer the society much more. For example; Doctors. 5. ) Why not just let families decide if they would like to pay for their child's education? My rebuttal is this, Human beings are selfish. Maybe selfish is an inadequate word to portray my thoughts. But essentially humans want all the cool things without the baggage. We want to own a BMW, A Lexus, a brand new Ford F350, pop out 8 kids while we eat Applebees every night. My point is humans live outside their means. They end up straining our society by contributing little to nothing. If we didn't make it mandatory for them to contribute the $5,400 a year they wouldn't. Make our nation stronger & smarter by contributing to education. If your child chooses not to obtain a higher level of learning then you now have $96,000 eliminating any other debt you may have obtained. 6. ) Families should pay different amounts based on household income. I realize that making a individual pay $5,400 on a $24,000 is unreasonable. The lack of money could lead to more crime in our society. In this scenario the family should only be charged $1,500 so on & so forth. If you fall under $18,000 a year you should be exempt from fees. Conclusion; Again I would like to thank the Pro for taking this debate. I am interested in the response. For Pro to win this debate I would like him/her come up with logical and rational reasons why my argument is unreasonable. Resources; A. ) . http://www.mybudget360.com...

Text: None","Hello, this will be a debate on whether or not federal student loans should be abolished. As pro, I will affirm that the federal student loan system is more harmful than beneficial to society, and that there are better alternatives to the current system. Con will be defending the status quo. I would like a debater who has had at least 3 debates completed. The debate will be 4 rounds, with an 8,000 character limit. First round may be for acceptance only or for con's first arguments, depending on what con wishes to do. I hope for a great debate!"

Text: None","Christmas is clearly not a scam. It is a historical, celebrated festival that is marked all over the Western world (and increasingly in the non-Western world). It honours a religious event, the birth of Christ, and present buying is, whilst also a long-standing tradition, not at all compulsory. What people choose to do to mark the occasion is their own business. No one obligates them to buy presents. It is possible to celebrate Christmas giving simple gifts at the end of a relaxed family meal, or possible to burn out one's overdraft and credit cards buying opulent gifts and an expensively showy meal for extended family. No one makes anyone choose either of those options, or any other. Advertising naturally encourages people to take one option over the other; businesses want to make money, so of course they subvert the meaning of Christmas into being about buying as much as is possible for as many people as possible. They do not hold anyone down and force them into it. Admittedly there is a lot of psychological pressure placed on parents, in particular, to buy as much as they can, but it ultimately comes down to their own decision whether to shop or not. Even if someone does buy more than they can afford, the word 'scam' is not accurate to describe this. The word implies that people are spending money on something which ultimately is not as promised, and cons them. They are not. They are spending money on gifts, which they then give to people, who then use the gifts. This is a valid transaction for all parties. The central point, however, is that without any purchases at all, the concept of Christmas would still stand. There would still be religious celebrations. There would still be family meals, where people gather together to be close to each other. This seems to imply that it is not a scam."

Text: None","There are some strict rules that apply: 1. When you accept the debate, state your country, and state the numbers of your armed forces (aircraft, men, ships, etc.). Use this source for military numbers only, as it is the most reliable: http://www.globalfirepower.com......... 2. Each country's turn can range from about 3 days to 1 month long, so please take in consideration of how much you do in a turn, make it reasonable. (DO NOT try to win in one turn! Take into account that your opponent is also a living, thinking being that can adapt to a situation.) 3. Morale is a key factor in your armed forces' effectiveness. 4. You may produce more military forces (soldiers, ships, aircraft, tanks/humvees/cavalry), but it depends on your military budget, your country's population, and how industrialized your nation is. 5. You may choose to invade or defend. 6. You may choose whether or not it is I whom makes the first move or if it is you whom makes the first move. 7. If a nation's capital is destroyed/liberated, this does not necessarily mean that the war is won; the capital could be recaptured. 8. You can have ONLY ONE WMD. (Chooses WMD) 9. WMD is to be used as a last resort. It can only be used if there is an extreme threat to the nation. 10. IF a WMD is to be used, you MUST fully describe the effects of its' use IN DETAIL. Every aspect of the WMD's effects MUST be correct and realistic. Any unrealistic detail in the effects will cause the use of the weapon and ALL of its' effects to become void, and there will be no ""restocking"" of the WMD. Once you use it, you used it, whether or not the effects are void. 11. Every aspect of the war MUST be realistic. Any unrealistic detail will cause the entire action to be void. Three infractions of this rule will result in an immediate defeat. 12. At the beginning of the ""war,"" you MUST specify what country you are, what WMD you will use (and describing the weapon using the below rules in the weapons' list), and you must show what the entirety of your armed forces is made of (soldier count, tanks, artillery, ships, aircraft, etc.). 13. Specify what your WMD is going to be. Specify ALL measurements of the WMD (yield, range, parts-per-million, altitude, longitude, latitude, etc). 14. You may choose ONE weapon from the following list of WMDs: - Nuclear Weapon: No larger than a 50 kiloton yield. MUST specify type of detonation (underground/collapse, ground/shock, air burst/dust). MUST specify location of detonation (longitude, latitude, altitude. Also name country, province/state, and city of detonation). *I would like to thank @maydaykiller for pointing out that 20 kiloton-yield nukes are almost nonexistent, and the use thereof is not realistic.* - Chemical: Maximum 15 parts-per-million. Specify chemical type. Anthrax and all nerve agents ARE allowed, but only one can be used. - MOAB: Able to penetrate a bunker with a maximum depth of 30 feet. Any measurement under 30 feet is accepted. Must be used on bunkers ONLY. - Biological: Minimum parts-per-million of 15. Maximum initial infection of 1,000 people, but the infection may spread further. - Radiological: Specify and describe the used radioactive material at the beginning of the war. MUST specify location of detonation (longitude, latitude, altitude. Also name country, province/state, and city of detonation). 15. No allies (NATO, UN, or otherwise) under ANY circumstances. You CAN have military or diplomatic agreements and/or treaties with other nations. *I would like to thank @IcySound for pointing this out.* 16. No insults, cursing, or any inappropriate behavior. 17. No trolling. 18. Disobedience of ANY of these rules WILL result in an immediate ""strike."" 19. If you acquire 3 ""strikes,"" you immediately forfeit the debate. 20. You can acquire all 3 ""strikes"" in one round or in more than one round. Regardless of how many ""strikes"" you have in a round, you forfeit that round, and all actions in that round are void. As said before, if you have 3 ""strikes,"" you lose the war. * I have removed Ballistic Missile due to the fact that it is not a WMD unless equipped with a nuclear-tipped payload, which I will not allow as you can already have one nuclear weapon (ballistic missiles can carry up to 12 warheads). *"

Doing so would deny the people of the failed state the right to chart their own future and be absent of the authorisation of the UN Charter, which states the organization is not allowed to intervene ‘in matters which are essentially within the domestic jurisdiction of any state’.[1] Furthermore, if the USA, or any one country, regularly intervened it would create more hostility towards that country, with accusations that it is acting out of a self-interested desire to exploit peoples economically. The personnel of that country could rapidly become a target for attacks. Nor is it desirable to encourage the UN to increase the level of its intervention in the domestic affairs of member states. This might start with weak countries but could rapidly become a habit and encourage the organisation in its ambitions to become a world government. [1] Ratner, S. R., & Helman, G. B. (2010, June 21).

Many kids have after school programs and that can get in the way of having time for homework, students may be up all night sometimes not even getting any sleep which can result in a drop in grades and overall performance, in school to just being social. Homework causes a lot of stress as well and stress has been proven to kill more people then pneumonitis in a year. Homework can cause more than physical health damage. As a child with a growing mind and a growing understanding of the world, you need free time, to explore, to play, to learn new things about the world, to go out and do things, and homework takes away from a lot of the time kids have to do those things"

Text: None","Yes homework needs to have a limit because the children do have lives and don't do work all the time. They come home and they do chores for their parents. They go to parties and family affairs and maybe even host their own. Some might be in sport leagues and will be very busy and they might have clubs. So they might not have enough time to work on their homework. Also if they do, they will spend at least a little bit of it in enjoyment. I mean, everyone does this. Even the teachers who assign the homework. We all spend time enjoying ourselves once we come home after a long day of working. Therefore, the children might not have enough time to complete massive amounts of homework. Another point would be that, if the children have that much homework they will be extremely stressed with the stress of completing it and making sure it has good quality. This stress is definitely not good for their health, and in turn they might just give up. They just will go like i just can't do it and they won't do it. This would decrease their grades. if teachers give so much, they will get worse quality work and there would be less effort put in. So they might as well give less homework, so we will all do better and do our absolute best. All resulting in better quality work for in which both teacher and student will be happy about."

Text: None","Why does homework have to be banned? Well, because, even though that some adults (including my parents) think that homework is needed for more practice and college preparation, I think that homework should be banned because children can spend more time with family, be less stressed out, and have more time to explore other interests. I see children cry, I see children complain, I see parents and/or teachers yell, and I see everyone cranky, tired, upset, grumpy, and all those words that means unhappy. What causes this negativity you ask? The answer is HOMEWORK!!! Children can spend more time with family if they did not have homework at night. For example, The family could go places, ride bikes, and explore nature. ""Banning homework effectively allows children to spend whatever little time they have before bed talking with their parents about their day in school and other topics."" (http://greengarageblog.org...) When it comes to family vacation time, me and my family feel a lot closer together. If I have a ton of homework, I would spend less time bonding with my family. Homework causes stress because sometimes it takes you a long time to finish. Homework also causes lack of sleep meaning that you will stay up late at night working on homework and getting less sleep. Then the next day you can be tired and grumpy and you fall asleep in class. You could get in trouble by your teacher if you fall asleep in class. You can also be too tired to participate in school activities and class then you may get very bad grades. ""Homework causes stress in many students. Homework takes time, and it keeps students up late at night getting the work done. The loss of sleep makes it hard to concentrate during class because students are so tired. I once stayed up until midnight and wound up very tired when morning arrived. It was hard to focus on my lessons. As a student, I think sleep is more important than doing homework. Students study during the day at schools and academies, so there is no reason that we have to get homework. Many schools have a one-hour rule, but with multiple classes and each teacher assigning one hour of homework, you end up with hours of work to do at home. Students in advanced levels get even more work than the students in basic classes."" (http://www.debate.org...) If you have too much homework you do not have enough time for hobbies or other interests like, playing sports or art classes. Having other interests are pretty important. Why? Because, if you have an interest, like pottery for example, and you want to have that job when you grow up, you can get an after school class there and when you grow up, you got the job. ""Most students hate homework with a passion and agree it should be banned. Yet, there are ethical elements making people think twice about giving students assignments to complete at home. Even from a professional view there are reasons why banning homework would make sense. Parents, students, and educators may agree to an extent that such assignments may not be as effective. Why so? There are school districts that already have a ban and claim things have gotten easier."" (https://www.tcnjstudentactivities.com...) Even many teachers believe that homework should be banned because it""s a positive thing. Just think about it. If your child has 3 or 6 homework assignments, then your child not only would they not get to spend time with their families, but will not have time to be a kid. Think about how homework could affect your child in the future when they grow up. Some people think that homework is necessary because children need more practice and it prepares them for college. Part of the reason from my parent""s point of view of why homework should not be banned is because parents (including my parents) need to know what is going on in the classroom. Parents feel like they need to be more involved in their child""s education. To other parents who want their children to have homework every day, homework is a way that teachers, parents, and students to communicate. Teachers need to be more accountability in the classroom. Not only does homework could improve your child""s handwriting and reading skills, but it is more of a bonding experience. Homework gives you extra practice until your child is becoming confident. But, there are some parents and/or children around the world in different countries and different races who are taking all or most of the fun, positive things about homework and turning it into an actual, physical, negative, and realistic problem which can seriously cause more conflict with one family member to another and becomes less of a bonding experience. If this conflict goes on any longer, parents and children around the world not only will children stay up all night working on homework, but will also become enemies when it comes to homework. Even though that some adults (including my parents) think that homework is needed for more practice and college preparation, I think that homework must be banned because children should spend more time with family, be less stressed out, and have more time to explore other interests. So, yeah. That is why I hate homework and why it should be banned. And all of what I said is all true. Hell, my sister stood up till 11:30 pm working on homework and only got little hours of sleep. Like, how tired are you if you spend hours of homework and you fall asleep in class? Homework maybe a good thing, it gives you more time to study, but I'm sorry. If other people decide to turn homework into a problem, then it has to be banned. So, for humanity's sleeping hours sake, I think it is best to ban homework. And all I can say is that if you agree that homework must be banned, then your entire family is damn lucky. That is all I have to say."

Text: None","Underage drinking is a major problem in the world that has claimed many lives. There are multiple ways to die from alcohol: alcohol poisoning, drunk driving, and many other ways. No doubt about it, alcohol just starts trouble. Have you ever wondered what the leading reason for car crashes is? It isn’t texting or any usage of the phone. It is fully driving under the influence. Millions of Americans are pulled over and given a ticket for driving under the influence. People also die from alcohol poisoning, this number having been the leading cause of death in certain countries. In America, the death rate for alcohol poisoning in our youth has sky-rocketed in the past few years. It isn’t the leading cause but it is definitely one of the many causes of death that could easily be prevented. Many lives have been saved by the law that people under the age of twenty-one are unable to ingest alcohol. Scientists have found more than 25,000 lives have been effected (positively) by this law. Some people try to say that parents should be able to give their children small doses of the alcohol because it is in a controlled environment. Although, this isn’t always true. Some children may like the taste, and then sneak what to them appears to be a little bit but is actually a lot. Then they can eventually die from alcohol poisoning. When you are around the teen\preteen age, your brain is maturing. Alcohol damages the maturing process by killing brain cells. You may think that it ends at the age of eighteen, but you’d be incorrect. The maturing process is believed to end around the age of twenty-five. People say that if the alcohol age is lowered than it will make alcohol seem less appealing to children because of the adage “People want what they can’t have.” Although this may seem true, which it is, it will most likely make younger people drink which then rises the death rate from alcohol poisoning by a whopping amount. This law is put out for safety and completely based upon age. You may look and realize how low other countries drinking ages are. Depending on the country some don’t have a drinking age limit at all. You may think that those countries do well, but they have a lack of government. One of those countries is Jamaica, the only place in the world where it is legal to smoke pot. How is that right? Many of the laws in those other countries are lacking structure; many even lack government. That should make it common sense that we shouldn’t be like those types of countries, many of which are a part of the developing world. They are poor people whom spend all of their money on alcohol, when they could be buying resources like food, water, clothing, and or shelter. Parents don’t normally worry about their kids getting into alcohol because they believe that they have shielded them well enough so that they know better. Truth is children are ignorant and unknowing. People also think that their children don’t have access to alcohol, but when it comes right down to it, putting it on the top shelf won’t stop them. They have resources from school and other places such as (if you live in a big city) they can get it from almost any street side marketer. In 1996, 308 children died from alcohol poisoning; in 1997, 342 children died from alcohol poisoning; and in 1998, 300 children died from alcohol poisoning. As you may already be noticing, this is a very real issue amongst teen and young adults. (Yoon, Stinson, Yi, Dufour) In 1984, the law of minimum drinking age was made to be 21. Not only was in made illegal to drink alcohol under the age of 21, but you weren’t allowed to buy it or handle it either. Although, 19 states messed up when writing the law; instead of saying that drinking alcohol underage is illegal, they said that public possession and purchase were to be illegal. This law never mentions underage drinking, yet people still don’t do it in those states. This shows that people know what not to do, proving that it is only an act of common sense. (Hanson) Prohibition is what started the whole legal drinking age thing. The law was there before Prohibition, but wasn’t really enforced. Many children would drink on a regular basis and think nothing of it, but after Prohibition, it was considered a misdemeanor. It became impossible not to enforce because after the drinking age was lowered the rate of automobile crashes rose at an alarming rate. When government official found out about this number they changed the drinking age to twenty- one, and made sure to enforce the law so that the number would go down. (Whitehead, Williams) Some people even believe that twenty- one years of age is too young to start drinking because the human brain is not fully developed at that age. Although this is true, some people believe that it is already developed enough to drink at the age of twenty- one. If some people believe that twenty- one may even be too young, how can eighteen even be close? It is a proven fact that the human brain is fully developed by the age of twenty- five. Many people argue with that fact and have tried to prove it wrong a many of times. When it comes right down to it, they are arguing with science and when the brain is fully matured, not arguing that the legal drinking age should be lowered. People get offended when you tell them that they aren’t old enough to do something, and teens don’t really even care if they can drink or not. In the end, they just don’t want to be told that they can’t do something. Drinking will end someone’s childhood. Sometimes it will end more than just the kid’s childhood. Some parents think that it is OK for their children to drink under their supervision, so they allow them to do so. But, in reality, it is harmful for children, or anyone for that matter, to drink. Good parents do not allow their children to drink alcohol even under their supervision which is a smart thing to do. The best thing for parents to do is to not even talk about alcohol because that will make their children want it more. The best thing to do is to create a modern day Buddha out of your child. You have to tell them some things, but keep quiet when it comes to alcohol and drugs. Studies have shown that over fifty percent of children, who die from an alcohol and or drug related death, have parents that are alcoholics or various other types of addicts. Many people have become interested in this topic. There are people on either side of the argument, but many more people appear to be siding with the no drinking side. So many lives have been saved by this law; in fact, this law has saved more lives than most laws combined. It has become noticed that in the past month 26.4% under-aged people have use alcohol, and binge drinking among the same age group was 17.4%. this shows how unknowing and inattentive parents can be. If a child knows that they will be able to do something that they are not supposed to, they will do it. Peer pressure is a huge factor of alcohol abuse amongst teens. Recently, a news station did a report on peer pressure. They had three kids under video surveillance and they had a man drive up in an ice cream truck. After the kids got their ice cream the man asked if they wanted to see a tour of the truck. (The news team was trying to see if only one or two would get in the truck or if all three got in because of each other). The first two kids went into the truck without hesitation. The third kid was very cautious, but even he got in the truck. It is the same way with alcohol, if 90% of a party is drinking, chances are the other 10% will start drinking as well because they feel left out or uncool. Drinking alcohol is like putting poison in your body. It will hurt you no matter what age you are. Sometimes it will affect your mind, other times your body. People don’t realize what damage one drink can do to them because they haven’t ever read a document like this before. People who drink don’t even realize how much it will affect their social status, no one will want to hang out with them and or even be their friend. Some people will even laugh at them as a sign of disrespect. It is sad to see this happening to someone, but you must know that it is their own fault. People whom drink alcohol regularly are generally unhappy, unwanted, unloved, just plain old disliked. Don’t be the town drunk, but don’t be the person who pities him either. Drinking has ruined the economic lives of many as well. You may be out driving around doing errands or something and see a man hold a cardboard sign asking for money. Facts about this man are probably that he has bad luck, he is unemployed, and he is an alcoholic. You may be thinking that these are just a bunch of stereo-types, but in reality studies have proven these to be true. It has also been proven that if you give them money they will loose it, have it stolen from them, spend it on beer or drugs, or just waste it. It has been proven that they only use it for something useful 18% of the time. 18% just think about that number for a while."

Text: None","My opponent seemed to believe that this resolution was undebatable. I'm here first of all to prove him wrong, and second of all to show why I've long thought that the voting age restriction should definitely be lowered. Some ground rules. There are four rounds, 72 hours per round, 8000 characters in each round. Debaters should post all their arguments and sources in their rounds, and voters should consider nothing except the arguments and sources presented in the debate (comments not being considered part of the debate). I (obviously) have the burden of proof. The first round is for acceptance. The presumption of the resolution is that the voting age is currently 18 or higher. I'll presume that the debate is set in a reasonably western society without regard for any particular jurisdiction or legal code. Because the cultural, educational and social background of youth may be relevant to the debate, I think it is fair that all cultures are considered, given that most reasonably western societies are quite multicultural. The vote we're talking about specifically is any general vote to determine legislative and/or executive office, as the case may be in that jurisdiction, in a national election format (so local body elections could be excluded etc)."

Text: None","Everyone would agree that there has to be a minimum voting age. Most people believe that the line should be drawn at 18 rather than 16. Although some 16 year olds may be mature enough to vote, most have not yet formed political views of their own yet. On average, young people are much more likely to be ready for the responsibility of voting at 18. There is then no reason why 16 would make a better cut off point than 18. At both ages some rights are given, at both there will be some who pay tax who are not given representation, at both some will be immature. There is no clear dividing line so there can be no clear reasoning for lowering the voting age to 16.  "

Text: None","Round 2: PRO girr29 (vs) CON whitesoxfan450 I look forward to what should be a great debate and discussion about why surveillance cameras in public areas should be substantially increased. Before we start this round I would assume my opponent would accept the United States as the governmental system in which we talk about in this debate round. If they would like to make this a bigger issue in his next speech then I will address the issue there. I will first start off by defining three key terms to this debate that come to us from the Unabridged dictionary, from dictionary. com. Surveillance – a close observation of a person or group, especially one under suspicion. Public – open to all persons. Substantially – something basic or essential; fundamental. I reserve the right to define these terms again and any other terms that might become important throughout the rest of the debate round. Let's move to some argumentation. I: To start things off let's go in depth in the true meaning of this resolution. A: Let's first start by talking about the public areas. Public is defined as open to all persons So therefore, there is no invasion of privacy if the government put up some more cameras in the public. So the government will not be hurting any fundamental or human rights by making more surveillance cameras in public. B: Let's look to the surveillance part of the resolution. Surveillance is defined as a close observation of a person or group, especially one under suspicion. So the whole point of surveillance cameras are to keep us safer from the ones in public who are suspicious and could potentially commit suspicious acts. So the whole point of making more surveillance cameras is to keep us even safer from those who could potentially hurt us. C: Finally, let's look to the end of the resolution where it says should be substantially increased. That doesn't mean I have to do it, doesn't mean I need to make a plan, all it means is that I just have to agree that…. yes…we should make more surveillance cameras. But furthermore on this substantially is defined as something basic or essential; fundamental. I do believe that is something basic, that is essential, and that it is of course fundamental to improve the protection of the public and it can be done by making more surveillance cameras. II: The resolution affirmed improves the Safety, Security, and Stability of society. A: Safety, Security, and Stability, or as I like to call them, the three Ss, are inherent rights that a society deserves. By increasing the number of cameras in public areas, the three Ss have more potential to stand. That is why I do believe that the resolution should be affirmed because the three Ss should be upheld and that's why we should substantially increase the number of surveillance cameras in public. B: The fewer cameras there are, the higher chance of crime happening. If suspicious characters know there are less surveillance cameras watching them, they will be more willing to commit criminal acts. As a report in the csmonitor talked about in 2007 about surveillance cameras, ""a lot of the time people don't like the fact that big brother is watching them, but the matter of the fact is that big brother keeps us safe. Without someone watching us, this country would be a lot worse off. "" By having more surveillance cameras we truly do what is right for the public. III: A substantial increase SHOULD happen. A: Some arguments that might be brought up in this debate round are that I am trying to implement a plan or trying to make something happen. But that is not the burden of the pro in this round. I believe that all I have to prove is that it should happen. So I don't have to discuss how much money or man hours it would take to make more cameras go up or any real logistics of the situation, just that it should happen. B: The only argumentation that the con can really only bring up is that more surveillance means more watching over us like a big brother. But that shouldn't be a reason to not do something. Just because people don't liked being watched, doesn't mean we sacrifice our all together safety, security, and stability. So at the end of this debate round you have to look at the wording of the resolution. My first contention talks about the wording of the resolution and the importance of that. Then in my second and third I basically bring up the points about how the three Ss are protected on the pro, and that all I have to prove is that this should happen and I don't have to implement a plan."

The end result would be a world where everything is recorded on camera except for events that take place within private property and homes. The benefits of this would outweigh any consequences for one pivotal reason: Any crime that takes place in public will likely be solved. The suspect has nowhere to run; the police can trace the suspect's movements right back to his home address, where they can visit and subsequently arrest him. Kidnappers, murderers, rapists -- everyone will be caught and brought to justice. You will be CON; you will argue that CCTV cameras should not be in every public location."

Text: None","The motion in debate calls for the proposition to defend that in general, the sole owner of and provider for water should be the state. They have failed. There is no piece of evidence they presented that I didn’t either successfully debunk or accepted and then used against the motion. Some of their points weren’t supported by analysis or evidence. They said companies can’t be trusted to justify the proposal but in their rebuttal they accepted that governments, like Venezuela’s, can’t be trusted either. They said that the government is the only proper agent because of having the budget and the political support. I demonstrated that there are huge private companies and that there is growing discontent with state monopolies and growing acceptance of privatization (like in Scotland) and that a policy’s popularity is different than it’s quality. They proved that fresh water is dwindling, but failed at explaining why that means the motion should be approved. I countered by showing how by giving away water, you could cause it to dwindle faster. They conceded that there can be some privates amongst suppliers Prop We stand that the state should CONTROL the process in those cases where private industries supply the resource, to avoid speculation in emergency situations. Prop. contradicted itself. First they said that prop one cannot play with supply and demand with something as important as water. Privatize water would be like privatize air. We need them equally and the state should provide enough for everyone. And then, in another point they said prop We are not suggesting giving free bottle water to everyone but the company that provides this product should be owned by the state. So on one hand water should be free or near free (no supply and demand games) and on the other they say they are not suggesting free bottled water. And does a bottled water company enter the category of need? No. I provided a framework for analysis for the examples of both State being successful and privately owned companies failing: they’re isolated examples. I provided evidence that proves state owned is a bad idea because it usually fails. I explained why they usually fail. Political abuses, lack of innovation (when innovative technologies like desalination are crucial), too cheap prices creating a high demand. Also, I linked the examples of private failings to them being protected by the government’s dealings with lobbyists and pressure groups. Lastly I provided spaces the poor to still get water while keeping the quality for everyone else. For this reasons, I think this policy should be opposed."

Text: None","India is a booming economy with GDP growth of 7% over most of the last twenty years, and it is likely to overtake the UK economy within a decade.[1] As a result development aid today to India is small by comparison to what India itself can and does spend on its poorest citizens.

This foreign aid is therefore not essential for poverty reduction in India. Indeed China has been the country most successful at reducing poverty and it has done it through economic growth not large amounts of development aid.[3] Aid money should therefore go to countries that really do need the money for development rather than those who are already succeeding at financing it themselves.

On average there is one seat in the European Parliament for every 670,000 individuals in the EU however Malta (452,000) and Luxembourg (537,000) both have populations that are smaller than this. In effect each of these countries will only have around two thirds of a MEP. It is very unlikely that even the most popular Maltese and Luxembourgian parties will secure a seat in a fully proportional system with a single constituency. Two countries would therefore effectively be disenfranchised by this system."

Text: None","By denying people the ability to access sites set up by extremists, ISPs serve to increase extremists’ mystique and thus the demand to know more about the movement and its beliefs. When the public appears to oppose something so vociferously that it is willing to have its internet provider set aside the normal freedoms usually taken as granted, people begin to take notice. There are always groups of individuals that wish to set themselves up as oppositional to the norms of society, to transgress against its mores and thus challenge what they see to be a constraining system.[1] When extremist beliefs are afforded this mystique of extreme transgression, it serves to encourage people, particularly young, rebellious people to seek out the group and even join it. Such has been the case of young, disaffected Muslims in Europe, and the United Kingdom in particular. These young people feel discriminated against by the system and seek to express their anger in the public sphere. Islamists have been able to capitalize on this disaffection in their recruitment and have become all the more attractive since their sites have come under attack by the UK government.[2] By allowing free expression and debate, many people would be saved from joining the forces of extremism.

Text: None","Taxation should not be about trying to engineer a more equal society. The purpose of taxes is to furnish necessary services people need to become competitive free agents in the economy. Progressive taxes take unduly from some to give to others in the hope of fostering social equality. Yet such efforts can only be harmful, as they breed resentment from rich toward the poor for taking undue amounts of their wealth for their consumption, and feelings of entitlement from poor who feel the wealthy owe them the money they pay, and thus feel happy to levy ever more odious taxes from them.[1] Society is best served by promoting a system of taxation that fosters equality of opportunity, by providing essential services to which everyone contributes in accordance with their ability to pay. This is better serviced through a system of flat-taxes, such as in Russia where there is a flat tax of 13%,[2] that promote a system of proportionality in taxation, rather than progressive taxes that focus unduly upon the contributions of the few to the many.
